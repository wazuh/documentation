VirusTotal
==========================

(adapt to wodles...)

Introduction
--------------

The VirusTotal module for Wazuh consists of a Python script that integrates OSSEC with Virustotal. The main goal is to collect all hashes obtained by Syscheck daemon and check them against the Virustotal global database, a free service that analyzes files from malwares.

It checks if any new or changed file was infected with a malware or a virus in order to avoid unexpected system downtimes, technical difficulties, or other interruptions.

Requisites
--------------

You need to get an API key to use the VirusTotal Public API 2.0. To do so, just sign-up on the service, go to your profile and click on API Key.

.. note:: Virustotal Public Key is limited to at most 4 requests per minute.

You also need to have installed the manager `Wazuh HIDS. <https://github.com/wazuh/ossec-wazuh>`_

And finally you need at least up Python 2.7 in order to execute the VirusTotal module.


Install
--------------

Clone the repository: ::

 $ cd ~
 $ git clone http://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-virustotal

Copy the following files into ``/var/ossec/modules/virustotal`` folder on your machine: ::

 $ sudo mkdir -p /var/ossec/modules/virustotal
 $ sudo cp -pr wazuh-virustotal/wazuh_modules_virustotal.py /var/ossec/modules/virustotal
 $ sudo cp -pr wazuh-virustotal/config.py /var/ossec/modules/virustotal

Copy rules/decoders into the right OSSEC folder: ::

 $ sudo cp wazuh-virustotal/decoders_rules/virustotal_rules.xml /var/ossec/rules/
 $ sudo cp wazuh-virustotal/decoders_rules/virustotal_decoders.xml /var/ossec/etc/wazuh_decoders/

Update your ossec.conf file in ``/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf``, include new the rules file within the <rules></rules> section : ::

  <include>virustotal_rules.xml</include>

And add the Virustotal log file as localfile to monitor: ::


  <localfile>
    <log_format>syslog</log_format>
    <location>/var/ossec/modules/virustotal/virustotal_log</location>
  </localfile>

Restart your OSSEC Manager to apply changes ::

 $ sudo /var/ossec/bin/ossec-control restart

Configuration
--------------
You will need to configure some parameters in the configuration file config.py.

Replace your API KEY:  ::

 personal_API_Key = "your_key"

Then, if you wish, you can configure others parameters: ::

 log_file: Log module file (Absolute or relative path)
 db_file: Agents module data base (Absolute or relative path)
 sleep_time: Time (in seconds) between scans in syscheck folder


Running
--------------
To run VirusTotal for OSSEC you just need to execute the file wazuh_modules_virustotal.py with Python ::

 $ python wazuh_modules_virustotal.py

Run the module in background: ::

 $ python wazuh_modules_virustotal.py &> /dev/null

Alerts
--------------

By default a certain range of rules and decoders is already included, we encourage you to develop your own rules and decoders and configure the existing ones according to your needs.

Some pre-built rules:

=======  =====  =========================================================
  ID     Level  Description
=======  =====  =========================================================
113423   0      VirusTotal module has finished to scan Syscheck databases
113431   4      Very low risk file
113433   6      Medium risk file
113400   7      High risk file
113435   11     High risk file - EXE
=======  =====  =========================================================
