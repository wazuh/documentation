Insert a Wazuh API entry automatically
======================================

If you want to add the Wazuh API credentials on one of our apps more quickly (for instance, for deployment purposes) you can execute one of the following commands, depending on the app you're using:

Kibana app
----------

.. code-block:: none

  # curl -X POST "http://<ELASTICSEARCH_IP>:9200/.wazuh/_doc/1513629884013" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
  {
    "api_user": "<WAZUH_API_USERNAME>",
    "api_password": "<WAZUH_API_PASSWORD>",
    "url": "<WAZUH_API_URL>",
    "api_port": "<WAZUH_API_PORT>",
    "insecure": "true",
    "component": "API",
    "cluster_info" : {
      "manager" : "<WAZUH_MANAGER_HOSTNAME>",
      "cluster" : "<WAZUH_MANAGER_CLUSTER_NAME>",
      "status" : "<WAZUH_MANAGER_CLUSTER_STATUS>"
    },
    "extensions" : {
      "audit" : true,
      "pci" : true,
      "gdpr" : true,
      "oscap" : true,
      "ciscat" : false,
      "aws" : false,
      "virustotal" : false,
      "osquery" : false
    }
  }'

**Note the following:**

1. ``<ELASTICSEARCH_IP>`` is the URL to the **Elasticsearch host**.
2. The number used on the cURL command (``1513629884013``) is a random number **used to identify the Wazuh API entry** as unique. If you want to add more APIs, you must use a different number.
3. ``<WAZUH_API_USERNAME>`` and ``<WAZUH_API_PASSWORD>`` represent the **Wazuh API credentials** to be stored on the app.
4. The API password **must** be stored in *base64* format. Using ``echo -n '<WAZUH_API_PASSWORD>' | base64`` will return the password on the proper format to use.
5. ``<WAZUH_API_URL>`` and ``<WAZUH_API_PORT>`` are the **full IP address and the port** to the Wazuh API. The URL must include ``http://`` or ``https://``, depending on the current configuration.
6. ``<WAZUH_MANAGER_HOSTNAME>`` is the **hostname of the instance** where the Wazuh manager is installed. You can get this information just by running the ``hostname`` command on the manager host.
7. ``<WAZUH_MANAGER_CLUSTER_NAME>`` is the **name of the Wazuh cluster**. It's configured on the ``ossec.conf`` file. If you're not using the Wazuh cluster, use ``Disabled`` as the name.
8. ``<WAZUH_MANAGER_CLUSTER_STATUS>`` is the **current status** of the Wazuh cluster. Use ``enabled`` or ``disabled`` depending on your configuration.

Splunk app
----------

.. code-block:: console

  # curl -X POST "http://<SPLUNK_IP>:<SPLUNK_PORT>/en-US/custom/SplunkAppForWazuh/manager/add_api?url=<WAZUH_API_URL>&portapi=<WAZUH_API_PORT>&userapi=<WAZUH_API_USERNAME>&passapi=<WAZUH_API_PASSWORD>"

**Note the following:**

1. ``<SPLUNK_IP>`` is the **hostname or IP address** of the Splunk instance where the app was installed.
2. ``<SPLUNK_PORT>`` is the **port of the Splunk instance** where the app was installed. By default, it's 8000.
3. ``<WAZUH_API_URL>``, ``<WAZUH_API_PORT>``, ``<WAZUH_API_USERNAME>`` and ``<WAZUH_API_PASSWORD>`` represent the **Wazuh API credentials** to be stored on the app. Keep in mind that the Wazuh API URL must include ``http://`` or ``https://``, depending on the current configuration.
