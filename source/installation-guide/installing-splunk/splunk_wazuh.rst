Wazuh app for Splunk offers an UI to visualize Wazuh alerts and API data. Wazuh helps you to gain deeper security visibility into your infrastructure by monitoring hosts at an operating system and application level.

Installation
------------

1. Download the latest stable version from the Splunk app for Wazuh package repository. You can do it by ``curl`` with the following command:

 .. code-block:: console

      curl -o SplunkAppForWazuh.tar.gz https://packages.wazuh.com/3.x/splunkapp/v3.2.3_7.1.0.tar.gz

2. Install the Splunk app for Wazuh:

  The app uses the ``/SplunkAppForWazuh/default/indexes.conf`` file to create an index named 'wazuh' and ``/SplunkAppForWazuh/default/inputs.conf`` file to listen to forwarded data on port 9997 on the machine where it's already installed.

  .. warning::

    In the case you have an Indexer cluster, first delete `indexes.conf` and `inputs.conf` files for avoiding to create an index in the current machine, install the app on the Search Head machine and configure a 'wazuh' index following the `Splunk official documentation <http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/7.1.0/Indexer/useforwarders>`_ .

  a. CLI mode:

    .. code-block:: console

      # /opt/splunk/bin/splunk install app SplunkAppForWazuh.tar.gz

    .. code-block:: console

      # /opt/splunk/bin/splunk restart

  b. Web GUI:

    .. code-block:: console

      Apps -> Manage apps -> install app from file

3. Open Splunk on your desired browser and click on the Wazuh app icon:
