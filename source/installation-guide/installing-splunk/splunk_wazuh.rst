Wazuh app for Splunk offers an UI to visualize Wazuh alerts and API data. Wazuh helps you to gain deeper security visibility into your infrastructure by monitoring hosts at an operating system and application level.

Installation
------------

1. Download the latest Splunk app for Wazuh:

 .. code-block:: console

      curl -o SplunkAppForWazuh.tar.gz https://packages.wazuh.com/3.x/splunkapp/v3.4.0_7.1.2.tar.gz

2. Install the Splunk app for Wazuh:

  The app uses the ``/SplunkAppForWazuh/default/indexes.conf`` file to create an index named 'wazuh' and ``/SplunkAppForWazuh/default/inputs.conf`` file to listen to forwarded data on port 9997.

  .. warning::

    In case you have an Indexer cluster, first delete `indexes.conf` and `inputs.conf` files to avoid index creation in the current instance, then install the app on the Search Head and configure a 'wazuh' index following the `Splunk official documentation <http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/7.1.2/Indexer/useforwarders>`_ .

  a. CLI mode:

    .. code-block:: console

      # /opt/splunk/bin/splunk install app SplunkAppForWazuh.tar.gz

    .. code-block:: console

      # /opt/splunk/bin/splunk restart

  b. Web GUI:

    .. code-block:: console

      Apps -> Manage apps -> Install app from file

3. Open Splunk in your desired browser and click on the Wazuh app icon:
