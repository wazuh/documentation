Customize agents status indexation
==================================

The Wazuh app for Splunk has the ability to collect and index agents' status data periodically. This information is stored on a separate index called ``wazuh-monitoring-3x``. It comes enabled by default, but it's possible to disable it or adjust the polling frequency.

.. warning::
  At this moment, this feature only works when Splunk is installed using the :ref:`single-instance <splunk_basic>` mode.

To do this, open the inputs file located at ``/opt/splunk/etc/apps/SplunkAppForWazuh/default/inputs.conf``. The ``[script]`` section includes the following basic configuration:

.. code-block:: none
  :emphasize-lines: 2,4

  [script:///opt/splunk/etc/apps/SplunkAppForWazuh/bin/get_agents_status.py]
  disabled = false
  index = wazuh-monitoring-3x
  interval = 0 * * * *
  sourcetype = _json

- To disable the indexation of agents' status data, change the ``disabled`` field to *true*.

- By default, the script is configured to fetch and index agents' status data **every hour**.

- The ``interval`` field can be configured using a decimal number or a cron schedule.

  - If you specify the interval as a number, it may have a fractional component; for example, 3.14
  - To specify a cron schedule, use the following format: ``<minute> <hour> <day of month> <month> <day of week>``
  - Cron special characters are acceptable. You can use combinations of ``*``, ``,``, ``/``, and ``-`` to specify wildcards, separate values, specify ranges of values, and step values.

.. warning::
  Although the default interval value can be ``60.0`` seconds, we recommend a minimum frequency of one hour to avoid overloading issues due to the excessive creation of data into the index.

Save the file when you're done editing it, and restart Splunk:

.. code-block:: console

  # /opt/splunk/bin/splunk restart

.. note::
  You can find useful information about the ``inputs.conf`` file in the `official documentation <http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/8.0.0/Admin/Inputsconf>`_.
