Installing the Wazuh dashboard using the assistant
==================================================

Install and configure the Wazuh dashboard with the aid of the Wazuh installation assistant. Wazuh dashboard is a flexible and intuitive web interface for mining and visualizing the security events and archives.

Wazuh dashboard installation
-----------------------------

#. Download the Wazuh installation assistant. This step can be skipped if you have already installed Wazuh indexer on the same server.

   .. code-block:: console

      # curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/|WAZUH_CURRENT_MINOR|/wazuh-install.sh

#. Run the assistant with the option ``--wazuh-dashboard`` and the node name to install and configure the Wazuh dashboard. The node name must be the same used in ``wazuh-config.yml`` for the initial configuration, for example, ``dashboard``.
   
   .. note::
      
      Make sure that a copy of ``wazuh-install-files.tar``, created during the Wazuh indexer installation, is placed in your working directory.

   .. code-block:: console

      # bash wazuh-install.sh --wazuh-dashboard dashboard

   Once the assistant finishes the installation, the output shows the access credentials and a message that confirms that the installation was successful.

   .. code-block:: none
      :emphasize-lines: 4          
    
      INFO: --- Summary ---
      INFO: You can access the web interface https://<wazuh-dashboard-ip>
          User: admin
          Password: <ADMIN_PASSWORD>
      INFO: Installation finished.

   You now have installed and configured Wazuh. All passwords generated by the Wazuh installation assistant can be found in the ``passwords.wazuh`` file inside the ``wazuh-install-files.tar`` archive. To print them, run the following command:
   
   .. code-block:: console
   
      # tar -O -xvf wazuh-install-files.tar wazuh-install-files/passwords.wazuh

#. Access the Wazuh web interface with your credentials. 

   -  URL: *https://<SERVER_IP>*
   -  **Username**: *admin*
   -  **Password**: *<ADMIN_PASSWORD>*

   When you access the Wazuh dashboard for the first time, the browser shows a warning message stating that the certificate was not issued by a trusted authority. An exception can be added in the advanced options of the web browser. For increased security, the ``root-ca.pem`` file previously generated can be imported to the certificate manager of the browser instead. Alternatively, a certificate from a trusted authority can be configured.
