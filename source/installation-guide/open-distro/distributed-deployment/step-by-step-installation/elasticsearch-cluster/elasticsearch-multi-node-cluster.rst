Elasticsearch multi-node cluster
=================================

Open Distro for Elasticsearch is an open source distribution of Elasticsearch, a highly scalable full-text search engine. It offers advanced security, alerting, index management, deep performance analysis, and several other additional features.

This document will explain how to install Elasticsearch in a multi-node cluster. For resilience in case Elasticsearch nodes become unavailable, it is recommended to have an odd number of master eligible nodes, please take this into consideration when deciding the configuration of your Elasticsearch cluster.

.. note:: Root user privileges are necessary to run all the commands described below.


Installing Elasticsearch
------------------------

The installation process for a multi-node cluster will be explained in three parts. The first one refers to the configuration of the initial node, in which the SSL certificates that will be deployed to the subsequent nodes are generated. 

The second part will explain how to configure the remaining nodes of the cluster. Finally, the third part provides instructions for initializing the Elasticsearch cluster and verifying that everything is working properly.  


**Initial node**
****************

The following instructions are meant to be performed on the **first** Elasticsearch node to be configured.  

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Open Distro for Elasticsearch requires the Java Development Kit and other packages installation including ``wget``, ``curl``, and ``unzip`` that will be used in further steps:

.. include:: ../../../../../_templates/installations/elastic/common/before_installation.rst

Adding the Wazuh repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


.. tabs::


  .. group-tab:: Yum


    .. include:: ../../../../../_templates/installations/wazuh/yum/add_repository.rst



  .. group-tab:: APT


    .. include:: ../../../../../_templates/installations/wazuh/deb/add_repository.rst



  .. group-tab:: ZYpp


    .. include:: ../../../../../_templates/installations/wazuh/zypp/add_repository.rst



Elasticsearch installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install Open Distro for Elasticsearch:

.. include:: ../../../../../_templates/installations/elastic/common/install_elastic.rst

Elasticsearch configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To configure Elasticsearch download the following file ``/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml``:

.. include:: ../../../../../_templates/installations/elastic/common/elastic-multi-node/configure_elasticsearch_initial.rst

Elasticsearch roles and users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to use the Wazuh Kibana plugin properly, it is necessary to add the extra roles and users:

.. include:: ../../../../../_templates/installations/elastic/common/add_roles_and_users.rst

Certificates creation and deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Remove the demo certificates:

    .. include:: ../../../../../_templates/installations/elastic/common/remove_demo_certs.rst

#.  Generate and deploy the certificates:

    .. include:: ../../../../../_templates/installations/elastic/common/elastic-multi-node/generate_certificates.rst

#. Enable and start the Elasticsearch service:

    .. include:: ../../../../../_templates/installations/elastic/common/enable_elasticsearch.rst

.. note:: The Open Distro for Elasticsearch performance analyzer plugin is installed by default and can have a negative impact on system resources. We recommend removing it with the following command ``/usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-plugin remove opendistro_performance_analyzer``. Please be sure to restart the Elasticsearch service afterwards. 
 

**Subsequent nodes**
********************

The following steps **should be executed in each of the subsequent nodes** of the Elasticsearch cluster.

Elasticsearch installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install Open Distro for Elasticsearch:

.. include:: ../../../../../_templates/installations/elastic/common/install_elastic.rst


Elasticsearch configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To configure Elasticsearch download the following file ``/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml``:


.. include:: ../../../../../_templates/installations/elastic/common/elastic-multi-node/configure_elasticsearch_subsequent.rst


Certificates deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Remove the demo certificates:

    .. include:: ../../../../../_templates/installations/elastic/common/remove_demo_certs.rst

#. Configure Elasticsearch certificates:

    .. include:: ../../../../../_templates/installations/elastic/common/elastic-multi-node/deploy_certificates.rst

#. Enable and start the Elasticsearch service:

    .. include:: ../../../../../_templates/installations/elastic/common/enable_elasticsearch.rst

.. note:: The Open Distro for Elasticsearch performance analyzer plugin is installed by default and can have a negative impact on system resources. We recommend removing it with the following command ``/usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-plugin remove opendistro_performance_analyzer``. Please be sure to restart the Elasticsearch service afterwards. 


**Initializing the cluster**
****************************

Once the installation process is done in all the servers of the Elasticsearch cluster, run the security admin script on the **initial node**: 

Run the Elasticsearch's ``securityadmin`` script to load the new certificates information and start the cluster. To run this command, the value ``<elasticsearch_IP>`` must be replaced by the Elasticsearch installation IP:

  .. code-block:: console

    # /usr/share/elasticsearch/plugins/opendistro_security/tools/securityadmin.sh -cd /usr/share/elasticsearch/plugins/opendistro_security/securityconfig/ -icl -nhnv -cacert /etc/elasticsearch/certs/root-ca.pem -cert /etc/elasticsearch/certs/admin.pem -key /etc/elasticsearch/certs/admin.key -h <elasticsearch_IP>

Replace the value ``<elasticsearch_IP>`` by the Elasticsearch installation IP and run the following command to ensure that the installation has been successful:

.. code-block:: console

  # curl -XGET https://<elasticsearch_ip>:9200 -u admin:admin -k

An example response should look as follows:

.. code-block:: none
    :class: output

    {
      "name" : "node-1",
      "cluster_name" : "elasticsearch",
      "cluster_uuid" : "tWYgqpgdRz6fGN8gH11flw",
      "version" : {
        "number" : "7.10.2",
        "build_flavor" : "oss",
        "build_type" : "rpm",
        "build_hash" : "747e1cc71def077253878a59143c1f785afa92b9",
        "build_date" : "2021-01-13T00:42:12.435326Z",
        "build_snapshot" : false,
        "lucene_version" : "8.7.0",
        "minimum_wire_compatibility_version" : "6.8.0",
        "minimum_index_compatibility_version" : "6.0.0-beta1"
      },
      "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
    }


To verify the nodes that are connected to the cluster, replace ``<elasticsearch_ip>``  and run the following command: 

.. code-block:: console

  # curl -XGET https://<elasticsearch_ip>:9200/_cat/nodes -u admin:admin -k


It is highly recommended to change Elasticsearchâ€™s default passwords for the users found at the ``/usr/share/elasticsearch/plugins/opendistro_security/securityconfig/internal_users.yml`` file. More information about this process can be found :ref:`here <change_elastic_pass>`. It is also recommended to customize the file ``/etc/elasticsearch/jvm.options`` in order to improve the performance of Elasticsearch. Learn more about this process in the :ref:`Elasticsearch tuning <elastic_tuning>` section.



To uninstall Elasticsearch, visit the :ref:`uninstalling section <uninstall_elasticsearch>`.

Next steps
----------

The next step is the installation of the Wazuh server, select the cluster mode:

- :ref:`Wazuh single-node cluster<wazuh_single_node_cluster>`
- :ref:`Wazuh multi-node cluster<wazuh_multi_node_cluster>`
