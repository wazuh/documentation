Introduction
============


This section covers different options to set up Wazuh with Elastic Stack in a production environment. Although the :ref:`Jumpstart to Wazuh<all_in_one>` guide could be used in small production environments, it is not designed for high availability and scalable environments. This section is aimed to configure an environment with different levels of distribution and, in consequence, scalable environments with high availability.

Architecture

The following image summarizes the architecture possibilities with regards to single-node or multi-node cluster in Wazuh and Elasticsearch.

This architecture diagram represents a Wazuh - Elastic Stack production environment. The set of Wazuh agents (on the left) may communicate with the Wazuh cluster through a load balancer, but this is not required and may be omitted.

The Wazuh cluster (center) can be configured as a single-node cluster (only one server with a Wazuh manager installed) or a multi-node cluster (two or more Wazuh managers distributed over two or more servers). Only the Wazuh master node will have the Wazuh API installed. All the Wazuh cluster servers will have Filebeat installed.

An Elasticsearch cluster (right side) may consist on one or more nodes.

Kibana (above the Elasticsearch cluster) will retrieve data from both clusters, Wazuh and Elasticsearch in a comprehensive way.


Start deploying Wazuh server and Elastic Stack
----------------------------------------------

The installation guide starts with the Elasticsearch section. After Elasticsearch is configured, the guide will go through the Wazuh cluster installation document.
There are two Elasticsearch configuration types: single node cluster or multi-node cluster, depending on environment's requirements:

- :ref:`Elasticsearch single-node cluster<elasticsearch_single_node_cluster>`
- :ref:`Elasticsearch multi-node cluster<elasticsearch_multi_node_cluster>`
