.. warning::
    Wazuh v3 uses different index names and templates than Wazuh v2. For that reason, you will not able to see the alerts previous to the upgrade in Wazuh App. If you need to access them, you will need to reindex the previous indices.

.. note::
    If you find any issue during the upgrade process, feel free to ask for help in our `mailing list <https://groups.google.com/d/forum/wazuh>`_. The Wazuh team and other users of the Open Source community may be able to assist you.
