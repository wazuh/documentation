.. warning::
    Wazuh v2.x uses different indices and templates than Wazuh v1.x, so you will not be able to see the previous alerts using Kibana. In order to access these alerts, you will have to reindex the previous indices.

.. note::
    If you run into an issue during the upgrade process, feel free to ask for help in our `mailing list <https://groups.google.com/d/forum/wazuh>`_. The Wazuh team and other users of the Open Source community may be able to assist you.
