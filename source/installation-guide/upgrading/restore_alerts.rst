Restore Wazuh alerts from Wazuh 2.x
===================================

.. versionadded:: 3.1.0

After upgrading Wazuh from 2.x to 3.x, your alerts will not be lost, but you cannot visualize your old alerts in Kibana due to a change in the Wazuh alerts' template. So, in order to work again with your old alerts and the new ones, it is necessary to reindex your alerts in Elasticsearch, applying the new mapping.

To do so, you must download the ``restore_alerts.sh`` script `from this link <https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh/tree/master/extensions/elasticsearch/restore_alerts.sh>`_ and a Logstash's configuration file called ``restore_alerts.conf`` `from here <https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh/tree/master/extensions/elasticsearch/restore_alerts.conf>`_.

    .. code-block:: console

        $ curl -so restore_alerts.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wazuh/wazuh/masterextensions/elasticsearch/restore_alerts.sh
        $ curl -so restore_alerts.conf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wazuh/wazuh/masterextensions/elasticsearch/restore_alerts.conf


Once the script and the configuration file are downloaded, you can restore your Wazuh's alerts in two different ways: **restoring them from Elasticsearch** and index them in Elasticsearch or **restoring from your Wazuh's manager** and index them in Elasticsearch.

Restore the alerts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before you start restoring your alerts, you must stop Logstash.

    .. code-block:: console

        # systemctl stop logstash


Once you stopped Logstash, you can run the ``restore_alerts.sh`` script as **superuser** to reindex your old Wazuh alerts.

    .. code-block:: console

        # ./restore_alerts.sh 


.. note::
    The script needs Logstash to be installed in the same machine, so if the script can't find Logstash, the script will install it in order to do the job. After the reindex has finished, you can uninstall Logstash.

After that, the script will ask you for information to fill in some needed parameters:

- ``reindex_type``: Store what kind of reindex do you want. It could be:
  - ``ELS2ELS``: from Elasticsearch to Elasticsearch.
  - ``WM2ELS``: from Wazuh's manager to Elasticsearch.

- ``elastic_ip``: Is the Elasticsearch IP address. By default, is `localhost`.
- ``dateFrom``: starting date as YYYY-MM-DD (2017-12-01).
- ``dateTo``: end date as YYYY-MM-DD (2017-12-11).

.. note::
    If you want to reindex only a day, set ``dateFrom`` and ``dateTo`` to the same date.

Also, you can execute the script adding the values for the parameters as arguments:

    .. code-block:: console

        # ./restore_alerts.sh date_from(yyyy-mm-dd) date_to(yyyy-mm-dd) elasticsearch_ip ELS2ELS|WM2ELS


Once the script has finished, you can start Logstash again:

    .. code-block:: console

        # systemctl start logstash

Check that the reindex has worked
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once the reindex of your alerts has finished, you can check that it works by asking Elasticsearch about the *indices*.

    .. code-block:: console

        $ curl localhost:9200/_cat/indices?v


If everything worked well, it must appear something like this in the output:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ curl -XGET localhost:9200/_cat/indices?v
