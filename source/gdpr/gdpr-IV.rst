GDPR IV, Controller and processor <gdpr_IV>
===========================================

In this chapter we can find requirements related to management, control and processing of personal data.

Chapter IV, Article 24, Head 2
------------------------------

**Article 24**  "Responsibility of the controller. **Head 2**. Where proportionate in relation to processing activities, the measures referred to in paragraph 1 shall include the implementation of appropriate data protection policies by the controller."

It will be necessary to comply with security and data protection policies. Therefore, the entity in charge of processing and storing data must be able to comply with these policies.

Wazuh monitors configuration files to ensure they are compliant with your security policies, standards and/or hardening guides. Agents perform periodic scans to detect applications that are known to be vulnerable, unpatched, or insecurely configured.

Policy monitoring is the process of verifying that all systems conform to a set of predefined rules regarding configuration settings and approved application usage. Wazuh uses three components to perform this task: `Rootcheck <https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/user-manual/capabilities/policy-monitoring/rootcheck/how-it-works.html>`_, `OpenSCAP <https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/user-manual/capabilities/policy-monitoring/openscap/index.html>`_ and `CIS-CAT <https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/user-manual/capabilities/policy-monitoring/ciscat/ciscat.html>`_.

Use cases
^^^^^^^^^

We can use rootcheck to monitor security policies. The first thing to do is to enable the appropriate rootcheck file.

.. code-block:: console

	root@agente:/home/agente# cat /var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf | grep system_audit_ssh -B 4 -A 2
	<rootkit_files>/var/ossec/etc/shared/rootkit_files.txt</rootkit_files>
	<rootkit_trojans>/var/ossec/etc/shared/rootkit_trojans.txt</rootkit_trojans>
	<system_audit>/var/ossec/etc/shared/cis_debian_linux_rcl.txt</system_audit>
	<system_audit>/var/ossec/etc/shared/system_audit_rcl.txt</system_audit>
	<system_audit>/var/ossec/etc/shared/system_audit_ssh.txt</system_audit>

If enabled, the file ``archives.log`` stores every log parsed by the Wazuh engine, whether it becomes an alert or not:

.. code-block:: console

	root@manager:/home/manager# tail -f /var/ossec/logs/archives/archives.log

Chapter IV, Article 28, Head 3 (c)
----------------------------------

**Article 28**  "Processor. **Head 3 (c)**. Processing by a processor shall be governed by a contract or other legal act under Union or Member State law, that is binding on the processor with regard to the controller and that sets out the subject-matter and duration of the processing, the nature and purpose of the processing, the type of personal data and categories of data subjects and the obligations and rights of the controller. That contract or other legal act shall stipulate, in particular, that the processor: takes all measures required pursuant to Article 32"

Entities must ensure data protection during data processing through technical and organizational measures. While processing data, it is necessary to ensure its protection and integrity in order to avoid any alteration that may be harmful to the individual to whom the information belongs.

By using `Syscheck <https://documentation.wazuh.com/3.x/user-manual/reference/ossec-conf/syscheck.html>`_ and through technical measures, Wazuh can ensure the protection measures established are met.
Use cases
^^^^^^^^^

Wazuh can help to control the security in the processing of data using Syscheck we can see the events that arise, the accesses, who performs them, etc.

Chapter IV, Article 30, Head 1 (g)
----------------------------------


**Article 30** "Records of processing activities. **Head 1 (g)**. Each controller and, where applicable, the controller's representative, shall maintain a record of processing activities under its responsibility. That record shall contain all of the following information: where possible, a general description of the technical and organisational security measures referred to in Article 32(1)."

It is necessary to keep all processing activities documented, to carry out an inventory of data from beginning to end and an audit, in order to know all the places where personal and sensitive data are located, processed, stored or transmitted.

Wazuh facilitates the development of documentation with a large amount of information about file access and security. It offers the possibility to store all the events that the manager receives in archives logs through `Log data collection <https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/user-manual/capabilities/log-data-collection/how-it-works.html>`_, in addition to storing alerts in alert logs and being able to use more logs and databases for various purposes, such as possible audits.

Here is an example of Wazuh rules tagged gdpr_IV_30.1.g:

.. code-block:: xml

	<rule id="516" level="3">
		<if_sid>510</if_sid>
		<match>^System Audit</match>
		<description>System Audit event.</description>
		<group>rootcheck,gdpr_IV_30.1.g,</group>
	</rule>

Use cases
^^^^^^^^^

Wazuh will generate an alert like this.

.. code-block:: console

	** Alert 1526470326.10972: - ossec,rootcheck,gdpr_IV_30.1.g,
	2018 May 16 13:32:06 (agent01) 192.168.1.50->rootcheck

	title: SSH Hardening - 9: Wrong Maximum number of authentication attempts
	file: /etc/ssh/sshd_config

We can also see the event stored in our log file ``archives.log``, as long as the ``log_all`` option is activated.

Chapter IV, Article 32,  Head 2
-------------------------------

**Article 32** "Security of processing. **Head 2**. In assessing the appropriate level of security account shall be taken in particular of the risks that are presented by processing, in particular from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed."

Entities will need account management tools that closely monitor actions taken by standard administrators and users using standard or privileged account credentials. This way, the data protection officer will be able to check who is accessing and processing the data, whether they are authorized to do so and whether they are who they say they are.

Wazuh offers functionalities to monitor access and use of standard or privileged accounts through its multiple monitoring tools.

Here is an example of Wazuh rules tagged gdpr_IV_32.2:

.. code-block:: xml

	<rule id="5710" level="5">
		<if_sid>5700</if_sid>
		<match>illegal user|invalid user</match>
		<description>sshd: Attempt to login using a non-existent user</description>

	</rule>


Use cases
^^^^^^^^^

Wazuh will generate an alert like this.

.. code-block:: console

	** Alert 1526481285.44363: - syslog,sshd,invalid_login,authentication_failed,pci_dss_10.2.4,pci_dss_10.2.5,pci_dss_10.6.1,gpg13_7.1,gdpr_IV_35.7.d,gdpr_IV_32.2,

Chapter IV, Article 33
----------------------

**Article 33**  "Notification of a personal data breach to the supervisory authority."

It is a required obligation to notify the supervisory authority of a violation of the data within 72 hours.

Wazuh can facilitate this communication, for example, notifying with `mail <https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/user-manual/manager/manual-email-report/index.html>`_ when a specific alert is triggered, or a group of alerts, related to the monitoring of the files that contain personal data. The rules used in event analysis can be configured to send emails to the relevant security officers.

Use cases
^^^^^^^^^

A sample email could be:

.. code-block:: console

	From: Wazuh <watcher@example.com>               5:03 PM (2 minutes ago)
	to: me
	-----------------------------
	Wazuh Notification.
	2017 Mar 08 17:03:05

	uid: 0
	euid: 0
	tty: ssh

	 --END OF NOTIFICATION

A basic configuration could be:

.. code-block:: xml

	<ossec_config>
	    <global>
	        <email_notification>yes</email_notification>
	        <email_to>data_protection_officer@test.com</email_to>

	        <email_from>wazuh@test.com</email_from>
	    </global>
	    ...
	</ossec_config>


Chapter IV, Article 35, Head 1
------------------------------

**Article 35** "Data protection impact assessment. **Head 1**. Where a type of processing in particular using new technologies, and taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing, is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller shall, prior to the processing, carry out an assessment of the impact of the envisaged processing operations on the protection of personal data. A single assessment may address a set of similar processing operations that present similar high risks."

Implement appropriate technical measures to safeguard the rights and freedoms of data subjects, informed by an assessment of the risks to these rights and freedoms.

Wazuh has security measures in place to safeguard personal data, as well as the ability to support risk assessment by categorizing Syschek alerts for certain files. For example, you can add the alert level of an event to support a risk assessment.

Use cases
^^^^^^^^^

One possibility is to use rules that, based on their fields, the module that generates them or the specific objective they affect, increase the alert level by supporting risk assessment.

In this case we would have a rule with an alert level 10 because data of a specific subject has changed. But if data belong to critical fields (in this example if the altered data is in ``/customers/personal_dat``), the alert level would rise to 15.

.. code-block:: xml

	<rule id="105756" level="10">
	    <if_matched_group>syscheck</if_matched_group>
	    <description>Changes made in the data of the subjects</description>
	</rule>

	<rule id="105757" level="15">
		<if_sid>105756</if_sid>
	    <if_matched_group>syscheck</if_matched_group>
	    <match>/customers/personal_data</match>
	    <description>Changes to //customers/personal_data - Critical file!</description>
	</rule>


Chapter IV, Article 35, Head 7 (d)
----------------------------------

**Article 35** "Data protection impact assessment. **Head 7 (d)**. The assessment shall contain at least the measures envisaged to address the risks, including safeguards, security measures and mechanisms to ensure the protection of personal data and to demonstrate compliance with this Regulation taking into account the rights and legitimate interests of data subjects and other persons concerned."

Necessary security measures include data breach identification, blocking and forensic investigation capabilities. Anti-malware and anti-ransomware are needed to ensure the integrity, availability, and resilience of data systems, blocking and preventing malware and rescue threats from entering devices.

Also behavioral analysis services that use machine intelligence to identify people who do anomalous things on the network may be required to provide early visibility and alert employees who become corrupt.

In order to meet these security requirements, Wazuh provides solutions such as intrusion and anomaly detection. Agents scan the system looking for malware, rootkits or suspicious anomalies. They can detect hidden files, cloaked processes or unregistered network listeners, as well as inconsistencies in system call responses. In addition, the integration of Wazuh with NIDS is viable.

Anomaly detection refers to the action of finding patterns in the system that do not match the expected behavior. Once malware (e.g., a rootkit) is installed on a system, it modifies the system to hide itself from the user. Although malware uses a variety of techniques to accomplish this, Wazuh uses a broad-spectrum approach to find anomalous patterns that indicate possible intruders. The main component responsible for this task is Rootcheck, however, Syscheck also plays a significant role.

We may be aware of application or system errors, misconfigurations, attempted and/or successful malicious activity, policy violations and a variety of other operational and security issues through Wazuh rules. Using Automated logs analysis Wazuh agents read operating system and application logs, and securely forward them to a central manager for rule-based analysis and storage.

It is worth highlighting the ability to detect vulnerabilities. Now agents are able to natively collect a list of installed applications, sending it periodically to the manager (where it is stored in local sqlite databases, one per agent). In addition, the manager builds a global vulnerabilities database, using public OVAL CVE repositories, using it later to cross correlate this information with agent’s applications inventory data.

Here is an example of Wazuh rules tagged gdpr_IV_32.2:

.. code-block:: xml

	<rule id="5712" level="10" frequency="6" timeframe="120" ignore="60">
		<if_matched_sid>5710</if_matched_sid>
		<description>sshd: brute force trying to get access to </description>
		<description>the system.</description>
		<same_source_ip />
		<group>authentication_failures,pci_dss_11.4,pci_dss_10.2.4,pci_dss_10.2.5,gdpr_IV_35.7.d,gdpr_IV_32.2,</group>
	</rule>

Use cases
^^^^^^^^^

Wazuh will generate an alert like this.

.. code-block:: console
