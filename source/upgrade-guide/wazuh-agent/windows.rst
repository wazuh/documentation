   When upgrading agents from versions earlier than 4.x, make sure that the communication protocol is compatible. Up to that point, UDP was the default protocol and it was switched to TCP for later versions. Edit the agent configuration file ``ossec.conf`` to update the :ref:`protocol <server_protocol>` or make sure that your Wazuh manager accepts :ref:`both protocols<manager_protocol>`.
