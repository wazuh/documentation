Upgrading Wazuh agents
======================

Follow these steps to update your ``Wazuh v1.x`` agents to ``Wazuh v2.x``.

a) On DEB or RPM based **Linux systems**, you can easily rely on the packages manager to upgrade your agents. The process differs very little from installing a new agent. More information is available in our documentation at:

  - :ref:`Install Wazuh agent on Linux <wazuh_agent_package_linux>`

  You can check your agent version by running the following command:

  .. code-block:: console

      # /var/ossec/bin/manage_agents -V

  .. code-block:: none
      :class: output
