Upgrading OSSEC Wazuh fork to a new version
===========================================

Here's a quick overview on how to upgrade the manager. The OSSEC agent (client) is simply just the binary that you install through your package manager (apt-get or yum). The OSSEC manager is installed through source, a little bit trickier but if you follow the below steps you should be on the safe side.

In case you need to upgrade the OSSEC manager to a new version (e.g bugfixes, or new features) you need to download the latest stable release from github and simply just run the install script. Make sure to backup both your current OSSEC installation (just in case!) including the OSSEC API.
Here's a list of most important files:

1. Make Backups of the current OSSEC installation and the API (make a tar.gz for just in case)
2. Stop OSSEC proccessec

::

  $ sudo /var/ossec/bin/ossec-control stop

3. Backup everything that is in /var/ossec/api -- especially the htpasswd as it includes the credentials to authenticate.
4. Clone the latest stable version of the Manager from https://github.com/wazuh/ossec-wazuh into the home directory

::

  $ cd ~
  $ mkdir ossec_tmp && cd ossec_tmp
  $ git clone https://github.com/wazuh/ossec-wazuh.git
  $ cd ossec-wazuh
  $ sudo ./install.sh

5. Run install.sh and select the Update option

::

  You already have OSSEC installed. Do you want to update it? (y/n): "y"

6. After the successful update, verify the new version in /etc/ossec-init.conf

::

  WAZUH_VERSION="v1.0.2"

7. Start OSSEC proccessec

::

  $ sudo /var/ossec/bin/ossec-control start

8. Make sure that the API process isn't running anymore, the process is "/bin/node /var/ossec/api/server.js". If it's running, stop/kill it.

::

  root@vpc-ossec-manager:~# ps axu | grep node
  root     10328  0.0  2.4 704800 24980 ?        Sl   Feb03   0:00 /usr/bin/node /var/ossec/api/server.js
  root     14426  0.0  0.0  10464   936 pts/0    S+   12:02   0:00 grep --color=auto node
  root@vpc-ossec-manager:~# kill -9 10328

9. Copy the content of github repository that you cloned ossec-wazuh/extensions/api into /var/ossec

::

  $ sudo cp -rf ~/ossec_tmp/ossec-wazuh/extensions/api  /var/ossec/

10. Replace the current htpasswd file with the one you backed-up earlier. The cloned github version only contains this string:

::

  "foo:$apr1$QJ8XkGFE$yEK2seDYoTIG.c6r03jjT/"
   
11. Start the API process once again, by running:

::

  $ /bin/node /var/ossec/api/server.js > /var/ossec/api/api.log & in the background

12. Verify if the API is working correctly by running this:

::

  https://server.ip:55000

or in a terminal: 

::

  $ curl -XGET -u username -k https://your.ip:55000/agents (replace 'username' with an existing user)

.. note:: Last but not least it also wouldn't hurt to update the latest OS packages by running ``yum update`` or ``apt-get update && apt-get upgrade``.
