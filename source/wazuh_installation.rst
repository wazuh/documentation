Wazuh HIDS
==========

Wazuh team has developed an OSSEC fork, implementing new features to improve OSSEC manager capabilities. These modifications do not affect OSSEC agents. Meaning that, if you are looking to install an agent, you just need to run a standard OSSEC installation and do not need to follow next steps. Documentation to perform an standard OSSEC installation can be found :ref:`here <ossec_installation>`.

Now, if you are installing an OSSEC manager, we strongly recommend you to use our forked OSSEC version. It provides compliance support, extended logging, and additional management features. Some of these capabilities are required for the integration with :ref:`ELK Stack <ossec_elk>` and :ref:`Wazuh RESTful API <ossec_api>`.

To start with this installation, first we need to set up the compilation environment by installing development tools and compilers. In Linux this can easily be done using your distribution packages manager:

For RPM based distributions: ::

   $ sudo yum install make gcc git

If you want to use Auth, also install: ::

   $ sudo yum install openssl-devel

For Debian based distributions: ::

   $ sudo apt-get install gcc make git

If you want to use Auth, also install: ::

   $ sudo apt-get install libssl-dev

Now we are ready to clone our Github repository and compile the source code, to install OSSEC: ::

   $ cd ~
   $ mkdir ossec_tmp && cd ossec_tmp
   $ git clone https://github.com/wazuh/ossec-wazuh.git
   $ cd ossec-wazuh
   $ sudo ./install.sh

Choose ``server`` when being asked about the installation type and answer the rest of questions as desired. Once installed, you can start your OSSEC manager running: ::

  $ sudo /var/ossec/bin/ossec-control start

Here are some useful commands to check that everything is working as expected. You should get  a similar output in your system. ::
