Regulatory compliance
=====================

Wazuh helps implement compliance requirements for regulatory compliance support and visibility. This is done by providing automation, improved security controls, log analysis, and incident response. 

The default Wazuh ruleset provides support for PCI DSS, HIPAA, NIST 800-53, TSC, and GDPR frameworks and standards. Wazuh rules and decoders are used to detect attacks, system errors, security misconfigurations, and policy violations.
