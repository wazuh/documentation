Securing API
========================================

By default, the communications with the API are not encrypted. You should take the following actions to secure your API:

 - Change default user/password.
 - Enable HTTPS.

You can change these options :ref:`manually <api_configuration>` or running the script ``/var/ossec/api/scripts/configure_api.sh``.
