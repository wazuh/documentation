Single-host architecture installation
==============================================

Usally, Wazuh is installed using a distributed architecture but you can optionally install the Wazuh Manager and Elastic Stack on the same server:

To do this, follow the guide :ref:`Installation via packages <installation_main>`, taking note of the special instructions about single-server deployments.  This will result in completely bypassing Filebeat, and instead just having Logstash locally read the *alerts.json* or *archives.json* file.
