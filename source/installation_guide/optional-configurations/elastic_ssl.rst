Setting up SSL for Filebeat and Logstash
========================================

If you are running Wazuh server and the Elastic Stack on separate systems (distributed architecture), then it is important to configure SSL encryption between Filebeat and Logstash.  This does not apply to single-server architectures.

Generating a self-signed SSL certificate
----------------------------------------

First, we need an SSL certificate and a key. 

1. On the **machine with Logstash server** installed, create a copy of the OpenSSL example configuration file. The file location may vary depending on your operating system:

	a. On Debian or Ubuntu::

		cp /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf custom_openssl.cnf

	b. On CentOS or Red Hat::

		cp /etc/pki/tls/openssl.cnf custom_openssl.cnf

2. Edit the custom configuration file, ``custom_openssl.cnf``.

	Find the section ``[ v3_ca ]`` and add a line like this, including your Elastic server's IP address::

		[ v3_ca ]
		subjectAltName = IP: YOUR_SERVER_IP

	For example::

		[ v3_ca ]
		subjectAltName = IP: 192.168.1.2

3. Generate the SSL certificate and key::

	openssl req -x509 -batch -nodes -days 3650 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/logstash/logstash.key -out /etc/logstash/logstash.crt -config custom_openssl.cnf

4. You may remove the custom configuration file::

	rm custom_openssl.cnf

Configure Logstash server
-------------------------

At this point you should have your certificate and key at ``/etc/logstash/logstash.crt`` and ``/etc/logstash/logstash.key`` respectively. Now we'll configure Logstash to use it on connections with Filebeat.

1. Edit file ``/etc/logstash/conf.d/01-wazuh.conf`` and uncomment the lines related to SSL under ``input/beats``. The active input section should now look like this::

	input {
	    beats {
	        port => 5000
	        codec => "json_lines"
	        ssl => true
	        ssl_certificate => "/etc/logstash/logstash.crt"
	        ssl_key => "/etc/logstash/logstash.key"
	    }
	}

2. Restart Logstash. The command depends on the OS init system:

	a. For Systemd::

		systemctl restart logstash.service

	b. For legacy SysV Init::

		service logstash restart

Configure Filebeat
------------------

Now we will configure Filebeat to verify the Logstash server's certificate.

1. On the **machine with Filebeat installed** (Wazuh server), fetch the Logstash server's file ``/etc/logstash/logstash.crt`` and copy it into ``/etc/filebeat/logstash.crt``.

	Here is an **example** of what you might to copy the cert from the Wazuh server to the Wazuh manager ::

		scp root@LOGSTASH_SERVER_IP:/etc/logstash/logstash.crt /etc/filebeat

2. Edit the file ``/etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml`` and uncomment the lines related to SSL inside ``logstash``. The file should remain like this::

	output:
	 logstash:
	   hosts: ["192.168.1.2:5000"]
	   ssl:
	     certificate_authorities: ["/etc/filebeat/logstash.crt"]

2. Restart Filebeat. The command depends on the OS init system:

	a. For Systemd::

		systemctl restart filebeat.service

	b. For legacy SysV Init::

		service filebeat restart
