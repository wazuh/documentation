Installing Elastic Stack
======================================

This guide describes the installation of Logstash, Elasticsearch, and Kibana on your Elastic Stack server.  We will illustrate package-based installations of these components below.  You can also also install them from binary tarballs, but this is rather less convenient and is outside of the scope of Wazuh documentation.
