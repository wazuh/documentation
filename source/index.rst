Wazuh is a free, open source and enterprise-ready security monitoring solution for threat detection, integrity monitoring, incident response and compliance.

------------
Capabilities
------------

Wazuh helps you to gain deeper security visibility into your infrastructure by monitoring hosts at an operating system and application level. This solution, based on lightweight multi-platform agents, provides the following capabilities:

.. raw:: html

   <div class="row capab">

.. topic:: Security Analytics
   :class: security col-md-6

   Wazuh is used to collect, aggregate, index and analyze security data, helping organizations detect intrusions, threats and behavioral anomalies.

.. topic:: Intrusion Detection
   :class: intrusion col-md-6

   Wazuh agents scan the monitored systems looking for malware, rootkits and suspicious anomalies. They can detect hidden files, cloaked processes or unregistered network listeners, as well as inconsistencies in system call responses.

.. topic:: Log Data Analysis
   :class: logdata col-md-6

   Wazuh agents read operating system and application logs, and securely forward them to a central manager for rule-based analysis and storage.

.. topic:: File Integrity Monitoring
   :class: fim col-md-6

   Wazuh monitors the file system, identifying changes in content, permissions, ownership, and attributes of files that you need to keep an eye on. In addition, it natively identifies users and applications used to create or modify files.

.. topic:: Vulnerability Detection
   :class: vulne col-md-6

   Wazuh agents pull software inventory data and send this information to the server, where it is correlated with continuously updated CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure) databases, in order to identify well-known vulnerable software.

.. topic:: Configuration Assessment
   :class: config col-md-6

   Wazuh monitors system and application configuration settings to ensure they are compliant with your security policies, standards and/or hardening guides. Agents perform periodic scans to detect applications that are known to be vulnerable, unpatched, or insecurely configured.

.. topic:: Incident Response
   :class: incident col-md-6

   Wazuh provides out-of-the-box active responses to perform various countermeasures to address active threats, such as blocking access to a system from the threat source when certain criteria are met.

.. topic:: Regulatory Compliance
   :class:  compliance col-md-6

   Wazuh provides some of the necessary security controls to become compliant with industry standards and regulations. These features, combined with its scalability and multi-platform support help organizations meet technical compliance requirements.

.. topic:: Cloud Security Monitoring
   :class: cloud col-md-6

   Wazuh helps monitoring cloud infrastructure at an API level, using integration modules that are able to pull security data from well known cloud providers, such as Amazon AWS, Azure or Google Cloud. In addition, Wazuh provides rules to assess the configuration of your cloud environment, easily spotting weaknesses.

.. topic:: Docker Security Monitoring
   :class: docker col-md-6

   Wazuh provides security visibility into your Docker hosts and containers, monitoring their behavior and detecting threats, vulnerabilities and anomalies. The Wazuh agent has native integration with the Docker engine allowing users to monitor images, volumes, network settings, and running containers. Wazuh continuously collects and analyzes detailed runtime information. For example, alerting for containers running in privileged mode, vulnerable applications, a shell running in a container, changes to persistent volumes or images, and other possible threats.

.. raw:: html

   </div>

This diverse set of capabilities is provided by integrating OSSEC, OpenSCAP and Elastic Stack into a unified solution and simplifying their configuration and management.

Wazuh provides an updated log analysis ruleset and a RESTful API that allows you to monitor the status and configuration of all Wazuh agents.

Wazuh also includes a rich web application (fully integrated as a Kibana app) for mining log analysis alerts and for monitoring and managing your Wazuh infrastructure.
