After creating a policy, you can attach it directly to a user or to a group to which the user belongs. In :ref:`attaching a policy to an IAM user group <attaching_policy_to_IAM_user_group>`, you see how to attach a policy to a group. More information on how to use other methods is available in the `AWS documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_change-permissions.html#users_change_permissions-add-console>`__.
