Installing Puppet master
============================

Installation on CentOS/RHEL/Fedora
------------------------------------

Install the Puppet yum repository and then the "puppet-server" package. See https://yum.puppetlabs.com to find the correct rpm file needed to install the puppet repo for your Linux distribution. For example, for CentOS 7 or RHEL 7, do the following::

   $ sudo rpm -ivh https://yum.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs-release-pc1-el-7.noarch.rpm
   $ sudo yum install puppet-server


Installation on Debian/Ubuntu
------------------------------

Install the Puppet apt repository, and then the "puppetserver" package.  See https://apt.puppetlabs.com to find the correct deb file to install the puppet repo for your Linux distribution.  For example, with the Trusty release of Ubuntu, you would do the following::

   $ wget https://apt.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs-release-pc1-trusty.deb
   $ sudo dpkg -i puppetlabs-release-pc1-trusty.deb
   $ sudo apt-get update && apt-get install puppetserver

Memory Allocation
--------------------------

By default, Puppet Server will be configured to use 2GB of RAM. However, if you want to experiment with Puppet Server on a VM, you can safely allocate as little as 512MB of memory. To change Puppet Server memory allocation, you can edit the following init config file.

  * ``/etc/sysconfig/puppetserver`` -- CentOS/RHEL/Fedora
  * ``/etc/default/puppetserver`` -- Debian/Ubuntu

Replace 2g with the amount of memory you want to allocate to Puppet Server. For example, to allocate 1GB of memory, use ``JAVA_ARGS="-Xms1g -Xmx1g"``; for 512MB, use ``JAVA_ARGS="-Xms512m -Xmx512m"``.

Configuration
--------------------------

Edit the ``/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/puppet.conf`` file, adding this line to the ``[main]`` section, and replacing ``puppet.example.com`` with your own FQDN: ::

   dns_alt_names = puppet,puppet.example.com

.. note:: If you find ``templatedir=$confdir/templates`` in the config file, delete that line.  It has been deprecated.

Then, restart your Puppet Server to apply changes: ::

   $ sudo service puppetserver start

PuppetDB installation
---------------------

After configuring Puppet Server to run on Apache with Passenger, the next step is to add PuppetDB so that you can take advantage of exported resources, as well as have a central storage location for Puppet facts and catalogs.

Installation on CentOS/RHEL 7 (Adjust if your version is different.)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
::

   $ sudo rpm -Uvh http://yum.postgresql.org/9.4/redhat/rhel-7-x86_64/pgdg-centos94-9.4-1.noarch.rpm
   $ yum install puppetdb-terminus.noarch puppetdb postgresql94-server postgresql94 postgresql94-contrib.x86_64
   $ sudo /usr/pgsql-9.4/bin/postgresql94-setup initdb
   $ systemctl start postgresql-9.4
   $ systemctl enable postgresql-9.4

Installation on Ubuntu 14.04 (Adjust if your version is different.)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
::

  $ sudo echo "deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ trusty-pgdg main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list
  $ wget --quiet -O - https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc | \
    sudo apt-key add -
  $ sudo apt-get update
  $ apt-get install puppetdb-terminus puppetdb postgresql-9.4 postgresql-contrib-9.4

Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For CentOS/RHEL/Fedora only, the next step is to edit ``/var/lib/pgsql/9.4/data/pg_hba.conf`` and modify the METHOD to be ``md5`` in these two lines:

::

  # IPv4 local connections:
  host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            md5
  # IPv6 local connections:
  host    all             all             ::1/128                 md5

Create a PostgreSQL user and database: ::

   # su - postgres
   $ createuser -DRSP puppetdb
   $ createdb -O puppetdb puppetdb

The user is created with no permission to create databases (-D), or roles (-R) and does not have superuser privileges (-S). It will prompt for a password (-P). Let’s assume a password of "yourpassword"” has been used. The database is created and owned (-O) by the puppetdb user.

Test database access and create the extension pg_trgm: ::

   # psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5432 -U puppetdb -W puppetdb
   Password for user puppetdb:
   psql (8.4.13)
   Type "help" for help.

   puppetdb=> CREATE EXTENSION pg_trgm;
   puppetdb=> \q

Configure ``/etc/puppetlabs/puppetdb/conf.d/database.ini``: ::

   [database]
   classname = org.postgresql.Driver
   subprotocol = postgresql
   subname = //127.0.0.1:5432/puppetdb
   username = puppetdb
   password = yourpassword
   log-slow-statements = 10

Create ``/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/puppetdb.conf``: ::

   [main]
   server_urls = https://puppetdb.example.com:8081

Create ``/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/routes.yaml``: ::

   ---
   master:
     facts:
       terminus: puppetdb
       cache: yaml

Finally, update ``/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/puppet.conf``: ::

   [master]
    storeconfigs = true
    storeconfigs_backend = puppetdb

Once these steps are completed, restart your Puppet Server and run ``puppet agent --test``: ::

   $ puppet agent --test

Now PuppetDB is working.
