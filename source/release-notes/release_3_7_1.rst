Collecting Audit events with custom keys
----------------------------------------

The Wazuh Integrity Monitoring engine (FIM engine) is capable of reading logs from the :ref:`Linux Audit events <system_call_monitoring>`. Each generated event is triggered by a defined rule and must have a key to be identified by Wazuh in order to perform a more accurate analysis.

In this new version, the FIM engine was improved and now can collect Audit events using custom keys. The new ``<audit_key>`` tag can be used to define the keys on the ``<syscheck><whodata>`` block from the :ref:`configuration file <reference_ossec_conf>`.

With this option, you can add other rule's keys generated manually or by other methods. It allows monitoring directories with Audit that have other associated rules. The Integrity Monitoring engine will filter the events looking for these keys.

Other minor improvements
------------------------

Wazuh 3.7.1 includes some other improvements to the main functionality. For instance:

- Restored the support for Amazon Linux on the :ref:`Vulnerability detector <vulnerability-detection>`.
- Improved performance of the *Remote* daemon.
- Added IPv6 support for the ``host-deny.sh`` script from :ref:`Active Response <automatic_remediation>`.
- Included more tracing information to the logs generated on debugging mode.
- The FIM engine now gives more descriptive messages when a file is not reachable.

This release also includes several bugfixes and stability improvements to the core components.
