Wazuh core
----------

**Automated deployment**

Agent installers support now :ref:`environment variables <automated_deployment_variables>` which allow deploy an agent in a simple step.

Here we can see an example for CentOS/RHEL:

.. code-block:: console

    $ WAZUH_MANAGER_IP="10.0.0.2" yum install wazuh-agent

The above example will install, configure and register the agent, making simple the deployment process.


**Security Configuration Assessment (SCA)**

Security Configuration Assessment (SCA) is a new module created to improve hardening and policy monitoring capabilities in Wazuh. Policy files are now in YAML format, making easier modifications and reading. Policies have been extended, useful compliance information has been added to each policy (rationale, remediation, CSC, etc.). Scan results are sent and stored in Manager side, being accessible using both the Wazuh API and the Wazuh app.

SCA includes a new database integrity algorithm (which will be included on other modules as FIM and Inventory in the coming releases). The agent will send only those checks which status have changed from previous scans, saving network traffic and decreasing manager load.

Here is an example that runs a scan the 15th of every month:

.. code-block:: xml

    <sca>
        <enabled>yes</enabled>
        <scan_day>15</scan_day>
        <policies>
            <policy>cis_debian_linux_rcl.yml</policy>
        </policies>
    </sca>

**Inventory module**

- Get network and open ports for Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 systems.
- Events information can be decoded into dynamic fields, so we can define rules based on *Inventory* events. Decoders now accept ``syscollector`` as value for ``<decoded_as>`` tags.
- Get the real MAC address of each interface in `/sys/class/net/address` instead of getting it from interfaces with *AF_PACKET* sockets, avoiding this way problems with bonded interfaces that share the same MAC address at software level.


**FIM: Who-data**

- Who-data now supports a pre-start health check to make sure Audit socket is ready.
- Who-data now supports symbolic links hot changes.
- Added support for *Fedora 29* systems that use *Audit 3.0*.

**AWS Organizations in CloudTrail**

With this enhancement, it is possible getting logs for created organizations by adding ``<aws_organization_id>ORGANIZATION</aws_organization_id>`` in the module configuration.

Here is an example of how to configure this new AWS capability:

.. code-block:: xml

    <wodle name="aws-s3">
        <disabled>no</disabled>
        <bucket type="cloudtrail">
            <name>cloudtrail</name>
            <aws_organization_id>wazuh</aws_organization_id>
            <aws_profile>default</aws_profile>
        </bucket>
        <remove_from_bucket>no</remove_from_bucket>
        <interval>20m</interval>
        <run_on_start>yes</run_on_start>
        <skip_on_error>no</skip_on_error>
    </wodle>

**Wazuh cluster**

- The Wazuh manager no longer has any external dependencies on Python. The manager now includes its own embedded Python 3 interpreter. Making easier to configure integrations as AWS, VirusTotal, Azure or Slack.
- Cluster synchronization speed is now 100x faster, thanks to *asyncio library* (`Asynchronous I/O <https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html>`_) which increases multi-threading performance and network communication.

Added *-t* and *-c* options for the Wazuh cluster daemon. Those options allow the user to test an isolated configuration file or to test the existing one configuration file.


**Other fixes and improvements**

- Fixed an error in the OSquery configuration validation. The ``osqueryd`` daemon started no matter the string it received, whether it was yes, no or anything else.
- Wazuh manager starts regardless of the contents of ``local_decoder.xml``.
- Prevent *Integrator, Syslog Client and Mail forwarded* from getting stuck while reading ``alerts.json``.
- Vulnerability detector module now checks that the severity of the alerts has been unified and it also checks if the database is empty before starting a new scan.
- Labels starting with ``_`` are now reserved for internal use only.
- Windows installer now load the corresponding configuration file based on the system version.
- Increase 80x ``remoted`` daemon performance for TCP connections.

Wazuh API
---------

- Manager configuration file is now editable.
- Creation, edition and removal of rules, decoders and CDB Lists is now supported.
- Multiple nodes restart.
- SCA endpoints for policies, scan and checks.
