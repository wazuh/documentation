4.2.2 Release notes - 28 September 2021
=======================================

This section lists the changes in version 4.2.2. Every update of the Wazuh solution is cumulative and includes all enhancements and fixes from previous releases.

Highlights
----------
This release includes highlighted features and enhancements.

Manager
^^^^^^^

- `#9779 <https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh/pull/9779>`_ Authd now refuses enrollment attempts if the agent already holds a valid key. With this added feature, Authd can only generate new keys if the agent key does not exist on the manager side. Based on this, the manager has the capability to decide if a new key should be generated or not. Since the introduction of *Enrollment* in version 4.0.0, Wazuh provides the user with an automated mechanism to enroll agents with minimal configuration. This registration method might cause agents to self-register under certain circumstances, even if they were already registered. This improvement prevents this issue from happening and avoids re-registering agents that already have valid keys. 

Agent
^^^^^

- `#9927 <https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh/pull/9927>`_ The Google Cloud Pub/Sub integration module is updated to increase processed events per second. The rework of this integration module allows multithreading, increases performance significantly, and adds a new ``num_threads`` option to the module configuration. The new multithreading feature allows pulling messages with multiple subscribers simultaneously, improving the performance drastically. In addition, this new Google Cloud integration includes some improvements in the pulling and acknowledging mechanism, and the socket connection as well.

Wazuh Kibana plugin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


- `#3175 <https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-kibana-app/pull/3175>`_ Wazuh improves the API selector and Index pattern selector of the Wazuh Kibana plugin, moving both from the main menu to the upper right corner of the header bar for quick access. This new UX improvement allows users to have better management of these two features.  As for visualization, the  **API** selector is displayed when there is more than one to select. The **Index pattern** selector is displayed under the same conditions and only contains index patterns that have Wazuh alerts.

- `#3503 <https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-kibana-app/pull/3503>`_ Wazuh adds a new functionality that allows users to change the logotype settings of the Wazuh Kibana plugin. From the **Logo Customization** section of the **Configuration** page, users can customize the logos of the app easily and to their liking. Setting options include customization of **Logo App**, **Logo Sidebar**, **Logo Health Check**, and **Logo Reports**.
