Assigning multiple groups to an agent
-------------------------------------

One of the most relevant enhancements of this new version consists on assigning agents to more than one group simultaneously.

With this improvement, it becomes possible the idea of merging configuration of various groups, sending to the agents belonging to that multiple groups the same configuration,
composed by the configuration files of all of them.

This new feature allows to consult all the agent's group information at *agent_groups* CLI and at the APP with the RESTful API.

You can learn more about this feature at the :ref:`multiple groups <grouping-agents>` documentation.

Query remote configuration
--------------------------

Querying for the agent's configuration in realtime is now possible.

This queries on demand permit searching for the enabled configuration applied to agent and manager in each moment, it allows to consult information about every enabled module as it can be seen in the following screenshot, where some basic agent information is shown.

Improved performance of FIM
---------------------------

The registries generated by the File Integrity Monitoring system are now stored at a new SQLite database, furthermore, the storage resources required has been reduced, being faster and more efficient.

Improved performance of Analysis engine
---------------------------------------

The analysis engine has been enhanced with multi-threaded processing, taking advantage of all the manager's resources by processing events in parallel, adquiring more performance per less cost.

New features for Kibana plugin
------------------------------

The Wazuh app for Kibana includes new features and interface redesigns to make use of the new features included in this version. As shown before, now you can see the actual manager/agent configuration on the redesigned tabs. The interface has been organized in a more convenient way, and each setting is displayed in a more *human-readable* format for better comprehension. Besides, the JSON/XML viewers received a revamp to be more responsive.

The app is also compatible with the new multiple groups feature, so now each agent will show all its assigned groups. Clicking on any group on the information bar will redirect the user to the groups detail page, to see the configuration files and all the agents belonging to that group.

We've also added more quality-of-life improvements for the app:

  - Clicking on an agent ID on the *Discover* panels will open the agent panel to see the associated dashboards.
  - New *Actions* column added on the agents list to quickily open the Discover panel or agent configuration.
  - The *Amazon AWS* tab has been redesigned to include more useful visualizations and your current :ref:`Amazon S3 <amazon>` wodle configuration.
  - The new :ref:`Osquery <osquery>` extension added on this version comes to show scans results in a more meaningful and easy to understand format.
  - Several text and description updates, more bugfixes, performance improvements, and compatibility with the latest Elastic Stack version.

New features for Splunk plugin
------------------------------

The Wazuh app for Splunk also receives lots of new features and improvements on this new version. The Configuration tab is also improved as on the Kibana plugin to show the real manager/agent configuration, and multiple groups support.

In addition to this, the Splunk app now includes the *Monitoring* tab to show cluster-related information, such as alerts by node, cluster configuration, alerts summary, etc. The *Integrity monitoring* tab was also update to reflect the latest changes from the Kibana app, including more useful visualizations. The *Amazon AWS* tab is now also available on the Splunk plugin to monitor your AWS-related alerts.

There are even more improvements and additions to the app, such as:

  - You can check our new documentation article to :ref:`set up a reverse proxy configuration <splunk_reverse_proxy>` for Nginx and the Splunk plugin.
  - Added a *Dev tools* tab to execute Wazuh API queries directly from the app, instead of using a terminal window.
  - Added a *Inventory data* tab to show :ref:`Syscollector <syscollector>` scans on your agents.
  - Added *app logs* to monitor to check and troubleshoot problems while using the app.
  - The new :ref:`Osquery <osquery>` tab added on this version comes to show scans results in a more meaningful and easy to understand format.
  - Several text and description updates, more bugfixes, performance improvements, and compatibility with the latest Splunk version.
