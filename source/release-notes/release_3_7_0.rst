Assigning multiple groups to an agent
-------------------------------------
One of the most relevant enhancements of this new version consists on assigning agents to more than one group simultaneously.

With this improvement, it becomes possible the idea of merging configuration of various groups, sending to the agents belonging to that multiple groups the same configuration,
composed by the configuration files of all of them.

This new feature allows to consult all the agent's group information at *agent_groups* CLI and at the APP with the RESTful API.

You can learn more about this feature at the :doc:`multiple groups <../user-manual/agents/grouping-agents>` section.
