Who-data
--------

The main feature introduced in this version is the ability to monitor the information relative to the user who
makes changes to any file monitored with FIM. This information (who-data) contains the user who makes the changes
and also the process used. This new functionality is available in Syscheck on Linux and Windows.
See the :doc:`Auditing who-data <../user-manual/capabilities/auditing-whodata>` section for further information.

- Added support for SHA256 checksum (by Arshad Khan @arshad01).
- Enhanced visualization of Syscheck alerts and include all the available fields in the Syscheck messages from the Wazuh configuration files.
- The value *xxx* (not enabled) was replaced for *n/a* if the hash couldn't be calculated.
- Fixed registry_ignore problem on syscheck for Windows when *arch="both"* was used.
- Allow more than 256 directories in real-time for Windows agent using recursive watchers.


Wazuh core
----------

- Added a new option to customize the output format per-target in Logcollector.
- Added support for unified WPK. Now the WPK files are compatible between versions for the same OS.
- The CA verification was fixed to allow with more than one *'ca_store'* definition.


Wazuh API
---------

- Added new API request: *GET/agents/stats/distinct*. This new request returns all the different combinations that agents have for the selected fields.
