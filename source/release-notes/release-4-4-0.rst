4.4.0 Release notes - 28 March 2023
======================================

This section lists the changes in version 4.4.0. Every update of the Wazuh solution is cumulative and includes all enhancements and fixes from previous releases.

Highlights
----------

This new version of Wazuh brings new features and adds support for some Linux distributions and integrations. For more details, the highlights of Wazuh 4.4.0 are listed below:

- IPv6 support for the enrollment process and the agent-manager connection
- Vulnerability detection support for SUSE agents
- Wazuh indexer and dashboard are now based on OpenSearch 2.4.1 version
- Rework of Ubuntu Linux 20.04 and 22.04 SCA policies
- Support for Azure Integration in Linux agents

Below you can find more information about each of these highlights.

Wazuh 4.4.0 brings IPv6 support when connecting and enrolling an agent to a manager. The IPv6 protocol can handle packets more effectively, enhance performance, and boost security. This new feature allows agents to register and connect through an IPv6 address.

SUSE agents now natively support vulnerabilities detection. Wazuh added full support for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server and Desktop operating systems versions 11, 12, and 15. The vulnerability Detector now scans the programs identified by ``syscollector``, looking to report vulnerabilities described in the `SUSE OVAL <https://www.suse.com/support/security/oval/>`_ and the `NVD <https://nvd.nist.gov/>`_ databases.

Wazuh indexer and dashboard bump to OpenSearch 2.4.1. The Wazuh indexer and the Wazuh dashboard are based on OpenSearch, an open source search and analytics project derived from Elasticsearch and Kibana. We generated and tested the ``wazuh-indexer`` Debian and RPM packages with OpenSearch 2.4.1 and the ``wazuh-dashboard`` Debian and RPM packages with OpenSearch dashboards 2.4.1. This way, we avoid earlier version vulnerabilities and incorporate new functionalities.

To solve some errors in the previous Ubuntu Linux 20.04 SCA Policy, we reworked the Ubuntu Linux 20.04 and 22.04 SCA policies. As part of this task, we used the *CIS Ubuntu Linux 22.04 LTS Benchmark v1.0.0* to update Ubuntu Linux 22.04 SCA Policy.

Wazuh added support for Azure Integration in Linux agents. Now this integration can run for both agents and managers. We modified the packages generation process to support Azure in those agents that are installed using the WPK packages. Each new WPK package contains all the updated binaries and source code, and the installer updates all files and binaries to support Azure integration.

Finally, itâ€™s essential to remark that we maintain support for all installation alternatives. Indeed we maintain and extend this support by adding more recent versions.

.. Note::
   Starting with Wazuh v4.5.0, the central components will only support the Amazon Linux, RHEL, CentOS, and Ubuntu operating systems whose versions are officially supported by their vendors. Wazuh agents will maintain their current support status.
