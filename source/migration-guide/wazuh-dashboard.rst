Migrating to the Wazuh dashboard
================================

Follow this guide to migrate from Open Distro for Elasticsearch Kibana 1.13 to the Wazuh dashboard. These instructions are intended for a standard Wazuh installation, you may need to make some changes to adapt them to your environment.

To guarantee a correct operation of Wazuh, make sure to also migrate from Open Distro for Elasticsearch to the Wazuh indexer. To learn more, see the :doc:`Migrating to the Wazuh indexer </migration-guide/wazuh-indexer>` documentation. 

.. note:: You need root user privileges to run all the commands described below.

#. Stop the Kibana service. 

   .. tabs::
   
    .. group-tab:: Systemd
   
     .. code-block:: console
   
      # systemctl stop kibana
   
    .. group-tab:: SysV init
   
     .. code-block:: console
   
      # service kibana stop  

#. Add the Wazuh repository. You can skip this step if the repository is already present and enabled on your server.

    .. tabs::


      .. group-tab:: Yum


        .. include:: /_templates/installations/common/yum/add-repository.rst



      .. group-tab:: APT


        .. include:: /_templates/installations/common/deb/add-repository.rst



#. Install the Wazuh dashboard package.

   .. tabs::

      .. group-tab:: Yum

         .. code-block:: console

            # yum -y install wazuh-dashboard|WAZUH_DASHBOARD_RPM_PKG_INSTALL|

      .. group-tab:: APT

         .. code-block:: console
              
            # apt-get -y install wazuh-dashboard|WAZUH_DASHBOARD_DEB_PKG_INSTALL|

   .. note::

      Make sure that your Wazuh manager is updated to the latest version. To learn more, see :ref:`upgrading_wazuh_server`. 

#. Create the ``/etc/wazuh-dashboard/certs`` directory, copy your old certificates to the new location and change ownership and permissions.    

   .. code-block:: console

     # mkdir /etc/wazuh-dashboard/certs
     # cp /etc/kibana/certs/kibana.pem /etc/wazuh-dashboard/certs/dashboard.pem
     # cp /etc/kibana/certs/kibana-key.pem /etc/wazuh-dashboard/certs/dashboard-key.pem
     # cp /etc/kibana/certs/root-ca.pem /etc/wazuh-dashboard/certs/root-ca.pem
     # chmod 500 /etc/wazuh-dashboard/certs
     # chmod 400 /etc/wazuh-dashboard/certs/*
     # chown -R wazuh-dashboard:wazuh-dashboard /etc/wazuh-dashboard/certs

#. Port your settings from ``/etc/kibana/kibana.yml`` to the ``/etc/wazuh-dashboard/opensearch_dashboards.yml`` file. You can omit the ``opensearch.username`` and the ``opensearch.password`` settings as they are now stored in the Wazuh dashboard keystore.

#. Add the password of the ``kibanaserver`` user to the Wazuh dashboard keystore.  Execute the command below and follow the instructions. You may find your old password in the ``/etc/kibana/kibana.yml`` configuration file. 

    .. code-block:: console
