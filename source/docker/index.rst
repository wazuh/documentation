  :description: Find instructions to deploy Wazuh using Docker containers.

`Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`_ is an open-source project that automates the deployment of different applications inside software containers. Docker containers wrap up a piece of software in a complete filesystem that contains everything it needs to run like: code, system tools, libraries, etc. This process guarantees that the system will always run the same, regardless the environment it is running.

We have created our own fork based on `"deviantony" dockerfiles <https://github.com/deviantony/docker-elk>`_ and `"xetus-oss" dockerfiles <https://github.com/xetus-oss/docker-ossec-server>`_. Thank you, Anthony Lapenna, for your contribution to the community. If you want to contribute to the Wazuh fork, please go to our `Docker repository <https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-docker>`_.

The images we created are in the `Docker hub <https://hub.docker.com>`_. You can install Wazuh with a single-host architecture using a set of Docker images that contains `Wazuh Manager <https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh>`_, `Wazuh API <https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-api>`_, `Filebeat <https://www.elastic.co/products/beats/filebeat>`_, `Elasticsearch <https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/elasticsearch/>`_, `Kibana <https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/kibana/>`_ and `Nginx <https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx/>`_.

This section will show you the process of installing and configuring the Wazuh deployment on Docker:
