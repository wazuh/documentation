When is my credit card charged?
-------------------------------

Each environment is charged monthly, according to the environment's beginning date.

Is my credit card information safe?
-----------------------------------

Your credit card information is sent securely to our billing provider, `Stripe <https://stripe.com>`_, and stored there.

Where can I see the next payment for an environment?
----------------------------------------------------

Go to the :doc:`See your billing cycle and history </cloud-service/account-billing/billing-history>` section to learn how to view the billing details of your environments.

What happens to my payments if I want to upgrade or downgrade a setting?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you choose to upgrade a setting, you need to make an immediate prorated payment. The upgrade becomes effective immediately, albeit leading to an increased price for your environment. Conversely, when downgrading a setting, the change takes effect in the subsequent billing cycle, with your price adjusted accordingly. See *Adjusting environment settings* for further details.

How do I view previous receipts and billing history?
----------------------------------------------------

Go to the :doc:`See your billing cycle and history </cloud-service/account-billing/billing-history>` section to learn how to download an overview of all invoices issued for your account.

How can I configure who receives receipts and billing notifications?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Go to :doc:`Update billing and operational contacts </cloud-service/account-billing/update-billing>` section to learn how to configure who receives receipts and billing notifications.


What are the available payment methods on Wazuh Cloud?
--------------------------------------------------------------

Credit or debit card payments are supported. To learn more about Wazuh supported cards, see the certified payment processor list of card brands in the `Stripe documentation <https://stripe.com/docs/payments/cards/supported-card-brands>`_.


Can I get a refund?
-------------------

Charges are nonrefundable, but if you want to cease using an environment, you can :doc:`cancel your environment </cloud-service/your-environment/cancel-environment>` anytime. No new charges are incurred beyond the current billing period. For any special considerations regarding a refund, contact us through the **Help** section of the Wazuh Cloud Console.

What is included in my Wazuh Cloud environment?
-----------------------------------------------

A full set-up of Wazuh, according to your setting, and a standard or premium support service.

How can I request more information?
-----------------------------------

You can contact the Wazuh team anytime through the **Help** section on your Wazuh Cloud Console.
