Access Wazuh WUI
================

The Wazuh dashboard has a flexible and intuitive web interface. Through this WUI, you have access to visualizations that give you a comprehensive insight into your monitored endpoints.

Follow these steps to access Wazuh dashboard:

#. Log in to the `Wazuh Cloud Console <https://console.cloud.wazuh.com/>`_.
#. Select the environment you want to access from the **Environments** page.
#. Click **Open Wazuh** to open Wazuh WUI.
#. Choose from one of these methods to log in:
  
  - Log in with the default credentials. You can view them by clicking the **Manage** button and selecting **Default credentials** on the environments page. These credentials will grant you access to the Wazuh WUI. 
  - If Single sign-on (SSO) is enabled, use your own account.
  - You can also log in with any user you created in Wazuh WUI.

It is highly recommended for security reasons to change the default password and create your own users. 

  .. note:: You can access the Wazuh WUI directly using the URL *https://<CLOUD_ID>.cloud.wazuh.com*, where ``<CLOUD_ID>`` is the Cloud ID of your environment.
