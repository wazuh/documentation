  :description: Discover the offline step-by-step process to install the Wazuh central components without connection to the Internet.

Offline installation
====================

You can install Wazuh even when there is no connection to the Internet. Installing the solution offline involves downloading the Wazuh central components to later install them on a system with no Internet connection. The Wazuh server, the Wazuh indexer, and the Wazuh dashboard can be installed and configured on the same host in an all-in-one deployment, or each component can be installed on a separate host as a distributed deployment, depending on your environment needs.

For more information about the hardware requirements and the recommended operating systems, check the :ref:`Requirements <installation_requirements>` section.

.. note:: You need root user privileges to run all the commands described below.

Prerequisites
-------------

- ``curl``, ``tar``, ``openSSL``, and ``setcap`` need to be installed in the target system where the offline installation will be carried out. ``gnupg`` might need to be installed as well for some Debian-based systems.

- In some systems, the command ``cp`` is an alias for ``cp -i`` — you can check this by running ``alias cp``. If this is your case, use ``unalias cp`` to avoid being asked for confirmation to overwrite files.

Download the packages and configuration files
---------------------------------------------

#. Run the following commands from any Linux system with Internet connection. This action executes a script that downloads all required files for the offline installation on x86_64 architectures. Select the package format to download.
    
   .. tabs::

        .. group-tab:: RPM

            .. code-block:: console
        
               # curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/|WAZUH_CURRENT_MINOR|/wazuh-install.sh
               # chmod 744 wazuh-install.sh
               # ./wazuh-install.sh -dw rpm

        .. group-tab:: DEB

            .. code-block:: console
        
               # curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/|WAZUH_CURRENT_MINOR|/wazuh-install.sh
               # chmod 744 wazuh-install.sh
               # ./wazuh-install.sh -dw deb
          
#. Download the certificates configuration file.

      .. code-block:: console

         # curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/|WAZUH_CURRENT_MINOR|/config.yml

#. Edit ``config.yml`` to prepare the certificates creation.

   -  If you are performing an all-in-one deployment, replace ``"<indexer-node-ip>"``, ``"<wazuh-manager-ip>"``, and ``"<dashboard-node-ip>"`` with ``127.0.0.1``.

   -  If you are performing a distributed deployment, replace the node names and IP values with the corresponding names and IP addresses. You need to do this for all the Wazuh server, the Wazuh indexer, and the Wazuh dashboard nodes. Add as many node fields as needed.


#.  Run the ``./wazuh-certs-tool.sh`` to create the certificates. For a multi-node cluster, these certificates need to be later deployed to all Wazuh instances in your cluster.

    .. code-block:: console

        # curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/|WAZUH_CURRENT_MINOR|/wazuh-certs-tool.sh
        # chmod 744 wazuh-certs-tool.sh
        # ./wazuh-certs-tool.sh --all

#. Copy or move ``wazuh-offline.tar.gz`` file and ``./wazuh-certificates/`` folder to a folder accessible to the host(s) from where the offline installation will be carried out. This can be done by using ``scp``.


Install Wazuh components from local files
-----------------------------------------

#. In the working directory where you placed ``wazuh-offline.tar.gz`` and ``./wazuh-certificates/``, execute the following command to decompress the installation files:

   .. code-block:: console

      # tar xf wazuh-offline.tar.gz

   You can check the SHA512 of the decompressed package files in ``wazuh-offline/wazuh-packages/``. Find the SHA512 checksums in the :doc:`/installation-guide/packages-list`.

Installing the Wazuh indexer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#.  Run the following commands to install the Wazuh indexer.

    .. tabs::

        .. group-tab:: RPM

            .. code-block:: console

               # rpm --import ./wazuh-offline/wazuh-files/GPG-KEY-WAZUH
               # rpm -ivh ./wazuh-offline/wazuh-packages/wazuh-indexer*.rpm

        .. group-tab:: DEB

            .. code-block:: console

                # dpkg -i ./wazuh-offline/wazuh-packages/wazuh-indexer*.deb

#. Run the following commands replacing ``<indexer-node-name>`` with the name of the Wazuh indexer node you are configuring as defined in ``config.yml``. For example, ``node-1``. This deploys the SSL certificates to encrypt communications between the Wazuh central components.

   .. code-block:: console

      # NODE_NAME=<indexer-node-name>

   .. code-block:: console

      # mkdir /etc/wazuh-indexer/certs
      # mv -n wazuh-certificates/$NODE_NAME.pem /etc/wazuh-indexer/certs/indexer.pem
      # mv -n wazuh-certificates/$NODE_NAME-key.pem /etc/wazuh-indexer/certs/indexer-key.pem
      # mv wazuh-certificates/admin-key.pem /etc/wazuh-indexer/certs/
      # mv wazuh-certificates/admin.pem /etc/wazuh-indexer/certs/
      # cp wazuh-certificates/root-ca.pem /etc/wazuh-indexer/certs/
      # chmod 500 /etc/wazuh-indexer/certs
      # chmod 400 /etc/wazuh-indexer/certs/*
      # chown -R wazuh-indexer:wazuh-indexer /etc/wazuh-indexer/certs

   Here you move the node certificate and key files, such as `node-1.pem` and `node-1-key.pem`, to their corresponding `certs` folder. They're specific to the node and are not required on the other nodes. However, note that the `root-ca.pem` certificate isn't moved but copied to the `certs` folder. This way, you can continue deploying it to other component folders in the next steps.

#. Edit ``/etc/wazuh-indexer/opensearch.yml`` and replace the following values:


   #. ``network.host``:  Sets the address of this node for both HTTP and transport traffic. The node will bind to this address and will also use it as its publish address. Accepts an IP address or a hostname.

      Use the same node address set in ``config.yml`` to create the SSL certificates.

   #. ``node.name``: Name of the Wazuh indexer node as defined in the ``config.yml`` file. For example, ``node-1``.

   #. ``cluster.initial_master_nodes``: List of the names of the master-eligible nodes. These names are defined in the ``config.yml`` file. Uncomment the ``node-2`` and ``node-3`` lines, change the names, or add more lines, according to your ``config.yml`` definitions.

      .. code-block:: yaml

        cluster.initial_master_nodes:
        - "node-1"
        - "node-2"
        - "node-3"

   #. ``discovery.seed_hosts:`` List of the addresses of the master-eligible nodes. Each element can be either an IP address or a hostname.
      You may leave this setting commented if you are configuring the Wazuh indexer as a single-node. For multi-node configurations, uncomment this setting and set your master-eligible nodes addresses.

       .. code-block:: yaml

        discovery.seed_hosts:
          - "10.0.0.1"
          - "10.0.0.2"
          - "10.0.0.3"

   #. ``plugins.security.nodes_dn``: List of the Distinguished Names of the certificates of all the Wazuh indexer cluster nodes. Uncomment the lines for ``node-2`` and ``node-3`` and change the common names (CN) and values according to your settings and your ``config.yml`` definitions.

      .. code-block:: yaml

        plugins.security.nodes_dn:
        - "CN=node-1,OU=Wazuh,O=Wazuh,L=California,C=US"
        - "CN=node-2,OU=Wazuh,O=Wazuh,L=California,C=US"
        - "CN=node-3,OU=Wazuh,O=Wazuh,L=California,C=US"

#.  Enable and start the Wazuh indexer service.

    .. include:: /_templates/installations/indexer/common/enable_indexer.rst

#. For multi-node clusters, repeat the previous steps on every Wazuh indexer node.

#. When all Wazuh indexer nodes are running, run the Wazuh indexer ``indexer-security-init.sh`` script on `any Wazuh indexer node` to load the new certificates information and start the cluster.

    .. code-block:: console

        # /usr/share/wazuh-indexer/bin/indexer-security-init.sh

#. Run the following command to check that the installation is successful. Note that this command uses localhost, set your Wazuh indexer address if necessary.

   .. code-block:: console

      # curl -XGET https://localhost:9200 -u admin:admin -k

Installing Filebeat
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Filebeat must be installed and configured on the same server as the Wazuh manager.

#.  Run the following command to install Filebeat.

    .. tabs::

        .. group-tab:: RPM

            .. code-block:: console

                # rpm -ivh ./wazuh-offline/wazuh-packages/filebeat*.rpm

        .. group-tab:: DEB

            .. code-block:: console

                # dpkg -i ./wazuh-offline/wazuh-packages/filebeat*.deb

#.  Move a copy of the configuration files to the appropriate location. Ensure to type “yes” at the prompt to overwrite ``/etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml``.

        cp ./wazuh-offline/wazuh-files/wazuh-template.json /etc/filebeat/ &&\
        chmod go+r /etc/filebeat/wazuh-template.json

#.  Edit ``/etc/filebeat/wazuh-template.json`` and change to ``"1"`` the value for ``"index.number_of_shards"`` for  a single-node installation. This value can be changed based on the user requirement when performing a distributed installation.

    .. code-block:: none
        :emphasize-lines: 5

        {
          ...
          "settings": {
            ...
            "index.number_of_shards": "1",
            ...
          },
          ...
        }

#. Edit the ``/etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml`` configuration file and replace the following value:

   .. include:: /_templates/installations/filebeat/opensearch/configure_filebeat.rst

#. Create a Filebeat keystore to securely store authentication credentials.

              }
            }
          }
        }


Your Wazuh server node is now successfully installed. Repeat the steps of this installation process stage for every Wazuh server node in your cluster, expand the **Wazuh cluster configuration for multi-node deployment** section below, and carry on then with configuring the Wazuh cluster. If you want a Wazuh server single-node cluster, everything is set and you can proceed directly with the Wazuh dashboard installation.

Wazuh cluster configuration for multi-node deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. raw:: html

  <div class="accordion-section">

After completing the installation of the Wazuh server on every node, you need to configure one server node only as the master and the rest as workers.


Configuring the Wazuh server master node
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

  #. Edit the following settings in the ``/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf`` configuration file.

      .. include:: /_templates/installations/manager/configure_wazuh_master_node.rst

  #. Restart the Wazuh manager.

      .. include:: /_templates/installations/manager/restart_wazuh_manager.rst


Configuring the Wazuh server worker nodes
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

  #. .. include:: /_templates/installations/manager/configure_wazuh_worker_node.rst

  #. Restart the Wazuh manager.

      .. include:: /_templates/installations/manager/restart_wazuh_manager.rst

  Repeat these configuration steps for every Wazuh server worker node in your cluster.

Testing Wazuh server cluster
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

To verify that the Wazuh cluster is enabled and all the nodes are connected, execute the following command:

  .. code-block:: console

    # /var/ossec/bin/cluster_control -l

An example output of the command looks as follows:

  .. code-block:: none
    :class: output

      NAME         TYPE    VERSION  ADDRESS
      master-node  master  |WAZUH_CURRENT|   10.0.0.3
      worker-node1 worker  |WAZUH_CURRENT|   10.0.0.4
      worker-node2 worker  |WAZUH_CURRENT|   10.0.0.5

Note that ``10.0.0.3``, ``10.0.0.4``, ``10.0.0.5`` are example IPs.

Installing the Wazuh dashboard
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#.  Run the following commands to install the Wazuh dashboard.

    .. tabs::

        .. group-tab:: RPM

            .. code-block:: console

                # rpm --import ./wazuh-offline/wazuh-files/GPG-KEY-WAZUH

            .. code-block:: console

                # dpkg -i ./wazuh-offline/wazuh-packages/wazuh-dashboard*.deb

#.  Replace ``<dashboard-node-name>`` with your Wazuh dashboard node name, the same used in ``config.yml`` to create the certificates. For example, ``dashboard``. Then, move the certificates to their corresponding location.

    .. code-block:: console

        # NODE_NAME=<dashboard-node-name>

    .. code-block:: console

        # mkdir /etc/wazuh-dashboard/certs
        # mv -n wazuh-certificates/$NODE_NAME.pem /etc/wazuh-dashboard/certs/dashboard.pem
        # mv -n wazuh-certificates/$NODE_NAME-key.pem /etc/wazuh-dashboard/certs/dashboard-key.pem
        # cp wazuh-certificates/root-ca.pem /etc/wazuh-dashboard/certs/
        # chmod 500 /etc/wazuh-dashboard/certs
        # chmod 400 /etc/wazuh-dashboard/certs/*
        # chown -R wazuh-dashboard:wazuh-dashboard /etc/wazuh-dashboard/certs

#. Edit the ``/etc/wazuh-dashboard/opensearch_dashboards.yml`` file and replace the following values:

   #. ``server.host``: This setting specifies the host of the back end server. To allow remote users to connect, set the value to the IP address or DNS name of the Wazuh dashboard.  The value ``0.0.0.0`` will accept all the available IP addresses of the host.

   #. ``opensearch.hosts``: The URLs of the Wazuh indexer instances to use for all your queries. The Wazuh dashboard can be configured to connect to multiple Wazuh indexer nodes in the same cluster. The addresses of the nodes can be separated by commas. For example,  ``["https://10.0.0.2:9200", "https://10.0.0.3:9200","https://10.0.0.4:9200"]``

        .. code-block:: yaml

             opensearch.ssl.verificationMode: certificate

#.  Enable and start the Wazuh dashboard.

    .. include:: /_templates/installations/dashboard/enable_dashboard.rst

#. **Only for distributed deployments**:  Edit the file ``/usr/share/wazuh-dashboard/data/wazuh/config/wazuh.yml`` and replace the ``url`` value with the IP address or hostname of the Wazuh server master node.

                     password: wazuh-wui
                     run_as: false

#.  Run the following command to verify the Wazuh dashboard service is active.

    .. include:: /_templates/installations/wazuh/common/check_wazuh_dashboard.rst

#.  Access the web interface.

    -   URL: *https://<wazuh_server_ip>*
    -   **Username**: admin
    -   **Password**: admin

Upon the first access to the Wazuh dashboard, the browser shows a warning message stating that the certificate was not issued by a trusted authority. An exception can be added in the advanced options of the web browser or, for increased security, the ``root-ca.pem`` file previously generated can be imported to the certificate manager of the browser. Alternatively, a certificate from a trusted authority can be configured.

Securing your Wazuh installation
--------------------------------


You have now installed and configured all the Wazuh central components. We recommend changing the default credentials to protect your infrastructure from possible attacks.

Select your deployment type and follow the instructions to change the default passwords for both the Wazuh API and the Wazuh indexer users.
