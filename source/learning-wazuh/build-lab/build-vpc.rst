Build the Wazuh Lab VPC
=======================

Here we will create the VPC and take care of all the VPC components that our EC2
instances will need to operate.

To get started, sign into your AWS console at
`this link <https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home>`_.  If you do not
already have an AWS account, sign up for one
`here <https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start>`_.

.. note::
  There will be costs involved in maintaining a Wazuh lab environment in AWS but they
  should be small.  Most costs only apply when your  instances are actually
  running.  It should cost you an estimated USD $3-4 per day to operate this
  lab with all EC2 instances running.  When all instances are shut down, and
  all Elastic IPs are released, a dormant lab would only cost around $3 per month
  (just the cost of EC2 block storage).  These are only estimates. See `this page
  <https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/>`_ for authoritative details on Amazon EC2
  pricing.






Create VPC
----------

Even if you already have one or more VPCs, you will be creating a new one.
Go to your `AWS VPC Dashboard <https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home?#vpcs:>`_
and click on **[Create VPC]**. Specify the *Name* and *IPv4 CIDR block* below, and
then click on **[Create]**.

Subnet
------

This VPC only needs one subnet, which we will set to the same as the CIDR block
of the VPC itself.  Click on the `Subnets
<https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home#subnets:>`_ link in your `VPC Dashboard
<https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home?#vpcs:>`_

.. thumbnail:: ../../images/learning-wazuh/build-lab/new-subnet-0.png
    :title: New VPC
    :align: center
    :width: 75%

and create a subnet with the *Name* and *IPv4 CIDR block* below.
Make sure to associate it with your "Wazuh Lab" VPC.  Then click on **[Create]**.

Internet Gateway
----------------

Your VPC needs an Internet Gateway so it can communicate with the Internet.
Click on the `Internet Gateways
<https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home#igws:>`_ in your `VPC Dashboard
<https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home?#vpcs:>`_ and click on
**[Create Internet Gateway]**.

.. thumbnail:: ../../images/learning-wazuh/build-lab/create-gateway-0.png
    :title: Create gateway
    :align: center
    :width: 75%



Name it as below and click on **[Create]**.

Next, click on **[Close]** then select the gate way and from the **[Action]** menu, select  **[Attach to VPC]**,

    :width: 75%

Select your "Wazuh Lab" VPC and click on **[Attach]**, at which point your new gateway
should appear with a green "attached" state.


Route Table
-----------

The route table for your new VPC must be associated with your subnet and gateway.
Click on the `Route Tables <https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home#routetables:>`_
link in your `VPC Dashboard <https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home?#vpcs:>`_
and select the route table for your "Wazuh Lab" VPC (you can find it
by searching for the VPC ID that it has been assigned). Click on the **[Routes]**
tab and on the **[Edit routes]** button, then on the **[Add route]** button.
Add a new route with a *Destination* of "0.0.0.0/0" and for the *Target*, click
on the empty field, select *Internet Gateway* and pick the Wazuh Lab Gateway
from the list.  Click on **[Save routes]** and then on **[Close]**.

The results should look like this (exact igw- id will be different):

Click on the "Subnet Associations" tab below and then on **[Edit subnet associations]**.
Select only your Wazuh Lab Subnet and click on **[Save]**.

Security Groups
---------------

We will need a couple of **Security Groups**, one for your Linux instances and
one for your Windows instance. We will allow inbound SSH/HTTPS traffic to the
Linux instances from the Internet and inbound RDP traffic to the Windows
instance from the Internet while allowing unrestricted communication within
the VPC and unrestricted outbound traffic.

Windows Security Group
::::::::::::::::::::::

Click on the
`Security Groups <https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home#securityGroups:>`_
link  in your `VPC Dashboard <https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home?#vpcs:>`_
and then on **[Create Security Group]**.  Create a security group as shown
below and click on **[Create]**.

.. thumbnail:: ../../images/learning-wazuh/build-lab/sec-group-win.png

    :align: center
    :width: 75%

Next select only the "Wazuh Windows" security group, click on the **[Inbound
Rules]** tab and on **[Edit rules]**.
Set up two rules as shown below and click on **[Save rules]**.

Linux Security Group
::::::::::::::::::::

Click again on **[Create Security Group]**.  Create a security group like below,
then click on **[Create]** and on **[Close]**.

.. thumbnail:: ../../images/learning-wazuh/build-lab/sec-group-lin.png

Next select only the "Wazuh Linux" security group, click on the **[Inbound Rules]**
tab, and click on **[Edit rules]**. Set up two rules like below, click on **[Save rules]**
and on **[Close]**.

SSH key pair
------------

You need to set up a **Key Pair** to use in authenticating with the EC2 instances
you are about to launch.  Go to the `Key Pairs <https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home#KeyPairs:>`_
link in your `EC2 Dashboard <https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home>`_ and
click on **[Create Key Pair]**. Name it "Wazuh_Lab", make sure that file format **pem** is selected and click on **[Create]**.
Your web browser should automatically download the key file **Wazuh_Lab.pem** at
this point.

.. thumbnail:: ../../images/learning-wazuh/build-lab/key-pair.png

Hold onto this file.  You will need it to gain access to your EC2 instances once
they are launched.
