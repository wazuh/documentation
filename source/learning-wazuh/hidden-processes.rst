Expose hiding processes
=======================

In this exercise you will safely implement a kernel-mode rootkit on your lab machine as a proof-of-concept for Wazuh rootkit detection.

This rootkit is able to hide itself from the kernel module list as well as hide selected processes from being visible
to ``ps``.

However, Wazuh will sill detect it using the system calls ``setsid()``, ``getpid()``, and ``kill()``. This makes
Wazuh a very effective Linux rootkit detection application by looking for general low-level hiding behavior.

1. Log on to your Linux Agent instance and become root.

    .. code-block:: console

        [root@linux-agent centos]$ sudo su -

2. Update your kernel and reboot.  This is necessary for the rootkit build process.

    .. code-block:: console

        [root@linux-agent centos]# yum -y update
        [root@linux-agent centos]# shutdown -r now

3. Log back into linux-agent and become root again.

    .. code-block:: console

        [root@linux-agent centos]$ sudo su -

4. In your linux-agent's ``/var/ossec/etc/local_internal_options.conf`` file, enable debug logging
   and speed up the rate at which rootcheck commences its first scan for the sake of this lab.

    .. code-block:: console

        # echo "syscheck.debug=2" > /var/ossec/etc/local_internal_options.conf
        # echo "agent.debug=2" >> /var/ossec/etc/local_internal_options.conf
        # echo "rootcheck.sleep=0" >> /var/ossec/etc/local_internal_options.conf
        # echo "syscheck.sleep=0" >> /var/ossec/etc/local_internal_options.conf
        # systemctl restart wazuh-agent

.. note::
    The ``/var/ossec/etc/internal_options.conf`` file contains all possible internal options that
    you can change, along with explanations.  While you can edit this file directly, it gets overwritten during
    Wazuh upgrades, so it is recommended that you copy the sections you want to customize from
    ``/var/ossec/etc/internal_options.conf`` to ``/var/ossec/etc/local_internal_options.conf`` where the changes
    will not be overwritten.
    The settings in **local_internal_options.conf** always take precedence over the
    settings in **internal_options.conf,** so editing the **local_internal_options.conf** file will ensure your
    changes will not be overriden.

5. Install certain packages required for building the rootkit:

    .. code-block:: console

        # yum -y install kernel-devel libgcc gcc git

6. Fetch the Diamorphine rootkit source code from GitHub

    .. code-block:: console

        # git clone https://github.com/wazuh/Diamorphine.git

7. Change into the Diamorphine directory and compile the source code:

    .. code-block:: console

        # cd Diamorphine
        # make

8. Load the rootkit kernel module and put it to use

    .. code-block:: console

        # insmod diamorphine.ko

    .. note::
        Depending on the environment the module will sometimes fail to load or function properly.
        If you receive the errors ``insmod: ERROR: could not insert module diamorphine.ko: Invalid parameters``
        or ``bash: kill: (509) - No such process`` in the next step, you can restart the linux-agent machine
        and try again. Sometimes it will take several tries to work.

The kernel-level rootkit “Diamorphine” is now installed on this system! By default it is hidden so we
are not able to detect it by running “lsmod”.  Only with a special "kill" signal can we make Diamorphine
unhide itself:  Try it out:

    .. code-block:: console

        # lsmod | grep diamorphine
        # kill -63 509
        # lsmod | grep diamorphine
        diamorphine            13155  0
        # kill -63 509
        # lsmod | grep diamorphine
        #


    In the case of Diamorphine, any attempt to send a kill signal ``-63`` to any process whether it exists or not,
    will toggle whether the Diamorphine kernel module hides itself.

    This rootkit also allows you to hide a selected processes from being seen by the "ps" command for example.
    Run the following commands to see how the rsyslog process is first visible, then send the ``-31`` signal to
    its pid and observe how the process is no longer visible

    .. code-block:: console

        # ps auxw | grep rsyslogd | grep -v grep
        root       732  0.0  0.7 214452  3572 ?        Ssl  14:53   0:00 /usr/sbin/rsyslogd -n
        # kill -31 $(pidof rsyslogd)
        # ps auxw | grep rsyslog | grep -v grep
        #

9. Next configure linux-agent to run rootcheck scans every 5 minutes setting the ``frequency`` option the ``<rootcheck>`` section of your agent's ``/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf`` file to **300** with the following:

    .. code-block:: xml

            <rootcheck>
              <disabled>no</disabled>
              <check_files>yes</check_files>
              <check_trojans>yes</check_trojans>
              <check_dev>yes</check_dev>
              <check_sys>yes</check_sys>
              <check_pids>yes</check_pids>
              <check_ports>yes</check_ports>
              <check_if>yes</check_if>

              <!-- Frequency that rootcheck is executed - every 12 hours by default-->

              <frequency>300</frequency>

              <rootkit_files>/var/ossec/etc/shared/rootkit_files.txt</rootkit_files>
              <rootkit_trojans>/var/ossec/etc/shared/rootkit_trojans.txt</rootkit_trojans>
              <skip_nfs>yes</skip_nfs>
            </rootcheck>

    Restart the agent.

    a. For Systemd:

      .. code-block:: console

        # systemctl restart wazuh-agent

    b. For SysV Init:

      .. code-block:: console

        # service wazuh-agent restart

    The next rootcheck scan should run shortly and it will alert about the rsyslogd process
    which we hid with Diamorphine.

10. Watch ``ossec.log`` on linux-agent for rootcheck activity that should start within 5 minutes of the agent restart.

        .. code-block:: console

            # tailf /var/ossec/logs/ossec.log | grep rootcheck

    You should see something like this shortly:

        .. code-block:: console

    We see various rootkit scanning measures taking place that correspond to the various
    ``<check_...>`` options specified in the ``<rootkit>`` section of ``ossec.conf``.
    The **check_rc_pids** scan is the one that will catch Diamorphine.

11. Now switch back to the manager, and look for alerts in ``/var/ossec/logs/alerts/alerts.log``
    similar to these ones:

 .. code-block:: console

     ** Alert 1571420732.2395049: - ossec,rootcheck,gdpr_IV_35.7.d,
            2019 Oct 18 17:45:32 (agent) any->rootcheck
            Rule: 510 (level 7) -> 'Host-based anomaly detection event (rootcheck).'
            Process '732' hidden from /proc. Possible kernel level rootkit.
            title: Process '732' hidden from /proc.

            ** Alert 1571420732.2395334: - ossec,rootcheck,gdpr_IV_35.7.d,
            2019 Oct 18 17:45:32 (agent) any->rootcheck
            Rule: 510 (level 7) -> 'Host-based anomaly detection event (rootcheck).'
            Process '740' hidden from /proc. Possible kernel level rootkit.
            title: Process '740' hidden from /proc.

            ** Alert 1571420732.2395619: - ossec,rootcheck,gdpr_IV_35.7.d,
            2019 Oct 18 17:45:32 (agent) any->rootcheck
            Rule: 510 (level 7) -> 'Host-based anomaly detection event (rootcheck).'
            Process '741' hidden from /proc. Possible kernel level rootkit.
            title: Process '741' hidden from /proc.

12. It is also possible to find the same event in Kibana by searching for "rootkit".

    .. thumbnail:: ../images/learning-wazuh/labs/kibana-rootkit.png
        :title: brute
        :align: center
        :width: 80%

13. Remember, if you run the same ``kill -31`` command as before against rsyslogd, the rsyslogd process will become visible again. The subsequent rootcheck scan would no longer alert about it.

14. Remove the rootkit from linux-agent since we don’t need it any longer.

        .. code-block:: console

            # rmmod diamorphine
            # kill -63 509
            # rmmod diamorphine

15. Remove the custom internal options on linux-agent's that we used for this lab.

        .. code-block:: console

            # rm -f /var/ossec/etc/local_internal_options.conf

16. In the ``<rootcheck>`` section of linux-agent's ``/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf`` file, disable rootcheck for now.

        .. code-block:: console

            <disabled>yes</disabled>

17. Restart the Wazuh agent on linux-agent

  a. For Systemd:

    .. code-block:: console

      # systemctl restart wazuh-agent

  b. For SysV Init:

    .. code-block:: console

      # service wazuh-agent restart
