Keep watch for malicious command execution
==========================================

Linux systems have a powerful auditing facility called `auditd`  which can give a very detailed accounting of actions and changes in a system, but by default, no auditd rules are active so we tend to miss out on this detailed history.

In this lab, we will configure auditd on a Linux machine to account for all commands executed by a given user, including commands run by this user
in a sudo command or after sudo-ing to `root`.  After causing some audit events to be generated, we will look them over in the Wazuh dashboard.
Then we will set up several custom Wazuh rules to alert on especially suspicious command calls, making use of the CDB list lookup capability that allows rules to look up decoded field values in various lists and to use the results as part of the alert criteria.

The Linux auditd system is an extensive auditing tool, which we will only touch on here. Consider reading the :ref:`system_call_monitoring` section to get a broader picture of the ways you can take advantage of it.

Turn on program call auditing on linux-agent
--------------------------------------------

#. Having already sudo-ed to `root` on our linux-agent machine, append the following audit rules to ``/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules``

    .. code-block:: console

        [root@linux-agent centos]# echo "-a exit,always -F auid=1000 -F egid!=994 -F auid!=-1 -F arch=b32 -S execve -k audit-wazuh-c" >> /etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules
        [root@linux-agent centos]# echo "-a exit,always -F auid=1000 -F egid!=994 -F auid!=-1 -F arch=b64 -S execve -k audit-wazuh-c" >> /etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules


   Where ``auid=1000`` represents the user ID. If unsure, you may verify this value by running: ``grep centos /etc/passwd`` (replacing `centos` if you have a
   different user name).

#. Then reload the rules and confirm they are in place:

    .. code-block:: console

        [root@linux-agent centos]# auditctl -R /etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules
        ...
        [root@linux-agent centos]# auditctl -l

    .. code-block:: none
        :class: output

        -a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S execve -F auid=1000 -F egid!=994 -F auid!=-1 -F key=audit-wazuh-c
        -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S execve -F auid=1000 -F egid!=994 -F auid!=-1 -F key=audit-wazuh-c


Trigger a few audit events
--------------------------

#. Dropping from `root` back to the unprivileged user, run a ping.

    .. code-block:: console

        [root@linux-agent centos]# exit

    .. code-block:: none
        :class: output

        logout

    .. code-block:: console

        [centos@linux-agent ~]$ ping -c1 8.8.4.4

    .. code-block:: none
        :class: output

        PING 8.8.4.4 (8.8.4.4) 56(84) bytes of data.
        64 bytes from 8.8.4.4: icmp_seq=1 ttl=51 time=1.09 ms

        --- 8.8.4.4 ping statistics ---
        1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% packet loss, time 0ms
        rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 1.093/1.093/1.093/0.000 ms

#. While still `centos`, use sudo to run a privileged commands.

    .. code-block:: console

        [centos@linux-agent ~]$ sudo cat /etc/shadow

    .. code-block:: none
        :class: output

        root:!!:17497:0:99999:7:::
        bin:*:17110:0:99999:7:::
        ...

#. Now sudo back to `root` and run other commands.

    .. code-block:: console

        [centos@linux-agent ~]$ sudo su -

    .. code-block:: none
        :class: output

        Last login: Tue Jun 14 12:54:52 UTC 2022 on pts/0

    .. code-block:: console

        [root@linux-agent ~]# df

    .. code-block:: none
        :class: output

        tmpfs             101460       0    101460   0% /run/user/1000


Look over the audit events
--------------------------

#. On the monitored Linux machine, inspect the content of ``/var/log/audit/audit.log``. Auditd writes events here, but it is not very readable. Thankfully the Linux Wazuh agents already monitor this file by default.

#. Search the Wazuh dashboard for ``rule.id:80792``.  That will catch all auditd command audit events.

#. Pick the following fields for columnar display:

    - data.audit.command
    - data.audit.auid
    - data.audit.euid
    - full_log

#. Explore the audit records, finding and examining your unprivileged ping, and your privileged ``cat`` and ``df`` calls.  They will be mingled with other commands.

#. The `centos` user has uid 1000.  User `root` has uid 0.  Notice the ``auid`` (audited user identity) always traces back to the `centos` user, even though the ``euid`` effective user identity is sometimes 0 and sometimes 1000 depending on whether privileges were escalated.  This allows you to see who actually ran the command with sudo or while sudo-ed to `root`.


Look over the relevant Wazuh rule
---------------------------------

#. Here is Wazuh rule 80792:

    .. code-block:: xml

      <rule id="80789" level="3">
        <if_sid>80700</if_sid>
        <list field="audit.key" lookup="match_key_value" check_value="execute">etc/lists/audit-keys</list>
        <description>Audit: Watch - Execute access: $(audit.file.name).</description>
        <group>audit_watch_execute,gdpr_IV_30.1.g,</group>
      </rule>  
          
    Parent rule 80700 catches all auditd events, while this rule focuses on auditd command events.  Notice how the ``<list>`` line in this rule takes the decoded ``audit.key`` value which all our auditd rules set to "audit-wazuh-c" presently, and looks this up in a CDB list called ``audit-keys`` to see if the ``audit.key`` value is listed with a value of "command".

#. Look over the key-value pairs in the lookup file.  The file is ``/var/ossec/etc/lists/audit-keys``.

    .. code-block:: none

        audit-wazuh-w:write
        audit-wazuh-r:read
        audit-wazuh-a:attribute
        audit-wazuh-x:execute
        audit-wazuh-c:command

    This CDB list contains keys and values separated colons.  Some lists only contain keys, in which case each key exists on a line of its own and is directly followed by a colon.

#. Notice that in addition to the text file ``/var/ossec/etc/lists/audit-keys``, there is also a binary ``/var/ossec/etc/lists/audit-keys.cdb`` file that Wazuh uses for actual lookups.


Create a list of commands that Wazuh will watch for
---------------------------------------------------

Wazuh allows you to maintain flat file CDB lists (key only or key:value) which
are compiled into a special binary format to facilitate high-performance lookups
in Wazuh rules.  Such lists must be created as files, added to the Wazuh
configuration, and then compiled.
After that, rules can be built to look up decoded fields in those CDB lists as
part of their match criteria.  Right now, we want to create a list of commands that Wazuh
will use to give us special alerts when executed.

#. On the Wazuh manager, create ``/var/ossec/etc/lists/suspicious-programs`` with this content:

    .. code-block:: none

        ncat:
        nc:
        tcpdump:
        ping:

#. On the Wazuh manager, add this to the ``<ruleset>`` section of ossec.configuration in ``/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf``:

    .. code-block:: xml

        <ruleset>
          <list>etc/lists/suspicious-programs</list>
          ....


#. Now let's add a new rule that uses this list as part of its criteria to do so add the following to ``/var/ossec/etc/rules/local_rules.xml`` on the Wazuh Manager.

    .. code-block:: xml

      <group name="audit">
        <rule id="100200" level="8">
            <if_sid>80792</if_sid>
            <list field="audit.command" lookup="match_key">etc/lists/suspicious-programs</list>
            <description>Audit: Suspicious Command: $(audit.exe)</description>
            <group>audit_command,</group>
        </rule>
      </group>

    In this case we are simply checking to see if the decoded ``audit.command`` value appears in our new CDB lists at all, without checking its value.


#. Restart the Wazuh manager:

   .. include:: /_templates/common/restart_manager.rst


#. On your Linux agent, install and run ``tcpdump`` to trip our new rule:

    .. code-block:: console

        [root@linux-agent ~]# yum -y install tcpdump
        [root@linux-agent ~]# tcpdump --version

#. Search the Wazuh dashboard for ``data.audit.command:tcpdump`` and expand the record, where you should see a ``rule.id`` of 100200.


Make a smarter list and rule
----------------------------

Let's make this list a little smarter by including values that indicate how alarmed we should be about a given program being run.

#. On The manager, replace the content of ``/var/ossec/etc/lists/suspicious-programs`` with the following:

    .. code-block:: none

        ncat:red
        nc:red
        tcpdump:orange
        ping:yellow


#. Now that our ``suspicious-programs`` list is more granular, let's create a higher severity rule to fire specifically on instances when a "red" program is executed.

   Add this new rule to ``/var/ossec/etc/rules/local_rules.xml`` on the Wazuh manager, directly after rule 100200 and before the closing ``</group>`` tag:

    .. code-block:: xml

        <rule id="100210" level="12">
            <if_sid>80792</if_sid>
            <list field="audit.command" lookup="match_key_value" check_value="red">etc/lists/suspicious-programs</list>
            <description>Audit: Highly Suspicious Command executed: $(audit.exe)</description>
            <group>audit_command,</group>
        </rule>


#. Restart the Wazuh manager:

   .. include:: /_templates/common/restart_manager.rst

#. On your Linux agent, install and run a "red" program (netcat):

    .. code-block:: console

        [root@linux-agent ~]# yum -y install nmap-ncat
        [root@linux-agent ~]# nc -v

#. Search the Wazuh dashboard for ``data.audit.command:nc`` and expand the record, noting especially the rule.description of "Audit: Highly Suspicious Command executed: /usr/bin/ncat"


Make an exception
-----------------

You have ``ping`` in your CDB list, but perhaps you have several systems that routinely ping 8.8.8.8 as a connectivity check and you don't want these events to be logged.  Another child rule of ``80297``, with a level of "0" can provide such an exception.

#. Add this new rule to ``/var/ossec/etc/rules/local_rules.xml`` on the Wazuh manager, directly after rule 100210 and before the closing ``</group>`` tag:

    .. code-block:: xml

        <rule id="100220" level="0">
            <if_sid>80792</if_sid>
            <description>Ignore pings of 8.8.8.8</description>
            <field name="audit.command">^ping$</field>
            <match>="8.8.8.8"</match>
            <group>audit_command,</group>
        </rule>

    This rule does not do a lookup, it just checks any auditd command records in which the ``ping`` command is called and the target IP address 8.8.8.8 is mentioned.

#. Restart the Wazuh manager:

   .. include:: /_templates/common/restart_manager.rst

#. On your Linux agent, test the rule by pinging both 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4.

    .. code-block:: console

        [root@linux-agent ~]# yum -y install tcpdump
        [root@linux-agent ~]# ping -c1 8.8.8.8
        [root@linux-agent ~]# ping -c1 8.8.4.4

#. Search the Wazuh dashboard for ``data.audit.command:ping``.  Notice that only the ping
   event involving 8.8.4.4 shows up, because the other one was ignored by this
   exception rule.


How to observe correct rules are evaluated
------------------------------------------

#. On your Linux agent, run a mundane command not listed in our CDB.

    .. code-block:: console

            [root@linux-agent ~]# sleep 1

#. Search the Wazuh dashboard for ``data.audit.command:sleep`` to find the resulting event. Copy the ``full_log`` value.

#. Run ``/var/ossec/bin/wazuh-logtest -v`` on the Wazuh Manager and paste in the ``full_log`` value from above.

#. Carefully note the order in which child rules of “80792 - Audit: Command” were evaluated:

   .. code-block:: none
      :class: output

      Trying rule: 80792 - Audit: Command: $(audit.exe).
      	*Rule 80792 matched
      	*Trying child rules
      Trying rule: 92600 - Executed python script.
      Trying rule: 100220 - Ignore pings of 8.8.8.8
      Trying rule: 100210 - Audit: Highly Suspicious Command executed: $(audit.exe)
      Trying rule: 100200 - Audit: Suspicious Command: $(audit.exe)


#. Remember that when a rule matches, if it has multiple child rules, they are not evaluated in order of ID nor in the order they appear in the rule file. Instead, child rules of level "0" are checked first since they are for making
   exceptions.  Then any remaining child rules are checked in the order of highest severity to lowest severity.  Keep this in mind as you build child rules of your own.

.. warning:: **Why does my new rule never fire?**

    Sometimes a new rule never matches anything because of a flaw in its criteria. Other times it never matches because it is never even evaluated.  Remember, ``wazuh-logtest`` is your friend.  Use it to see if your rule is being evaluated at all, and if not, what rule might be overshadowing it.


Remember to set your settings back to normal
--------------------------------------------


When testing different things, it is recommendable that you reverse the changes to keep your testing Lab clean. So new tests don't interfere with previous ones.

On the Linux agent, delete the two lines we added to ``/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules`` and reload the auditd rules:

.. code-block:: console

    -a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S execve -F auid=1000 -F egid!=994 -F auid!=-1 -F key=audit-wazuh-c
    -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S execve -F auid=1000 -F egid!=994 -F auid!=-1 -F key=audit-wazuh-c


.. code-block:: console

     [root@linux-agent centos]# auditctl -R /etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules

On your Wazuh manager, delete the line we wrote in the ``<ruleset>`` section of the configuration file ``/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf`` and restart the Wazuh manager. 

.. code-block:: xml

      <list>etc/lists/suspicious-programs</list>


.. include:: /_templates/common/restart_manager.rst
