==============

The Wazuh open source security platform is a versatile software that provides awareness
of an environment's security through a rich group of components and integrations.

Given the high adaptability of Wazuh, the possibilities that it provides are plentiful.
In this area of our documentation, you will find a progressive set of hands-on experiences
to accelerate your progress towards mastery of Wazuh.
