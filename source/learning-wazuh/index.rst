Learning Wazuh
==============

The Wazuh open source security platform is a versatile software that provides awareness 
of an environment's security through a rich group of components and integrations.

Given the high adaptability of Wazuh, the possibilities that it provides are plentiful. 
In this area of our documentation you will find a progressive set of hands-on experiences
to accelerate your progress towards mastery of Wazuh. 

Some of the labs will require skills that can be acquired in the previous labs, so we 
encourage you to do them in order.
