Install Splunk in single-instance mode
======================================

This document will guide you through the installation process for a single-instance distributed architecture, recommended for testing and evaluation purposes, or also for small-medium sized environments.

.. note::
  Many of the commands described below need to be executed with root user privileges.

These are the two main components in this type of distributed architecture:

- The **indexer** runs the Splunk engine. It reads forwarded data, parses, indexes and stores it as events that contain alert data generated by Wazuh manager sent by the Forwarder instance.
- The **forwarder** runs on the Wazuh manager and Wazuh API instance, it reads local data and sends it to the indexer.

.. warning::
  This documentation will install Splunk using the single-instance deployment schema. If you want a more advanced installation, check out the :ref:`multi-instance <splunk_distributed>` deployment schema.

Install Splunk Indexer
----------------------

This component works receiving the data flow streamed by a forwarder and stores it in a Splunk index.

1. Download Splunk v7.2.4 package from `its official website <https://www.splunk.com/en_us/download/partners/splunk-enterprise.html>`_.

  .. note::
    Splunk is not open source software and it requires a registered user and license in order to work. You can also use a free trial license.

2. Install the Splunk v7.2.4 package:

  a) For RPM based distributions:

    .. code-block:: console

      # yum install splunk-enterprise-package.rpm

  b) For Debian/Ubuntu distributions:

    .. code-block:: console

      # dpkg --install splunk-enterprise-package.deb

3. Ensure Splunk v7.2.4 is installed in ``/opt/splunk`` and start the service:

  .. code-block:: console

    # /opt/splunk/bin/splunk start

  .. note::
    You will be prompted for a name and password for the administrator user.

  After this step the Splunk Web service will be listening to port 8000. You can browse ``http://<your-instance-ip>:8000`` in order to access the Web GUI.

4. Optional. If you additionally want the Splunk service to start at boot time, please execute the following command:

  .. code-block:: console

    # /opt/splunk/bin/splunk enable boot-start

Now that you've finished installing Splunk on a single-instance mode, you can proceed with the next step and install the :ref:`Wazuh app for Splunk <splunk_app>`.
