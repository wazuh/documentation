Installing Puppet agent
=======================

In this section it is explained how to install *puppet-agent*. Follow this link to check the `official installation guide <https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/6.4/install_agents.html>`_.

We assume that you have already installed the ``apt`` or ``yum`` Puppet repository on your agent system in the same way that you did on your Puppet Server.

Installation on CentOS/RHEL/Fedora
----------------------------------

Install the Puppet yum repository and then the "puppet-agent" package. See this `index <https://yum.puppetlabs.com/>`_ to find the correct rpm file needed to install the puppet repo for your Linux distribution. For example, to install Puppet 5 for CentOS 7 or RHEL 7, do the following:

.. code-block:: console

    # rpm -ivh https://yum.puppetlabs.com/puppet5/puppet5-release-el-7.noarch.rpm
    # yum -y install puppet-agent

Installation on Debian/Ubuntu
-----------------------------

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| The releases supported by the manifest to install Wazuh are as follows:    |
+------------+---------+--------+---------+------+--------+---------+--------+
| **Ubuntu** | precise | trusty | vivid   | wily | xenial | yakketi | bionic |
+------------+---------+--------+---------+------+--------+---------+--------+
| **Debian** | jessie  | wheezy | stretch | sid                              |
+------------+---------+--------+---------+----------------------------------+

Install ``curl``, ``apt-transport-https`` and ``lsb-release``:

.. code-block:: console

    # apt-get update
    # apt-get install curl apt-transport-https lsb-release

Get the appropriate Puppet apt repository, and then the "puppet-agent" package. See https://apt.puppetlabs.com to find the correct deb file to install the puppet repo for your Linux distribution.

.. code-block:: console

    # wget https://apt.puppetlabs.com/puppet5-release-xenial.deb
    # dpkg -i puppet5-release-xenial.deb
    # apt update
    # apt-get install -y puppet-agent

Create a symbolic link between the installed binary file and your default binary file:

.. code-block:: bash

    # ln -s /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet /bin

Installation on Windows
-----------------------

1. Download the Windows `puppet-agent <https://downloads.puppetlabs.com/windows/puppet5/puppet-agent-5.1.0-x86.msi>`_ package.

    This package bundle all of Puppet's prerequisites.

    .. note::
      This is the package for a Puppet 5.1 version agent. If another package is needed, go to the `official directory <https://downloads.puppetlabs.com/windows/puppet5>`_ where all packages are available for download.

2. Install Puppet.

    a. Using command line:

      .. code-block:: bash

        msiexec /qn /norestart /i puppet-agent-<VERSION>-x64.msi

      Optionally, you can specify ``/l*v install.txt`` to log the installation’s progress to a file.

      You can also set several MSI properties to pre-configure Puppet as you install it. For example:

      .. code-block:: bash

        msiexec /qn /norestart /i puppet-agent-<VERSION>-x64.msi PUPPET_MASTER_SERVER=puppet.example.com

    b. Using the Windows GUI:

      - Execute the GUI with elevated privileges.

      - During installation, Puppet asks you for the hostname of your Puppet master server.

      - For standalone Puppet nodes that won’t connect to a master, use the default hostname (*puppet*). You might also want to install on the command line and set the agent startup mode to *Disabled*.

      - Once the installer finishes, Puppet will be installed and running.

Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Add the server value to the ``[main]`` section of the node’s ``/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/puppet.conf`` file, replacing ``puppet.example.com`` with your Puppet Server’s FQDN::

   [main]
   server = puppet.example.com

Restart the Puppet service:

.. code-block:: console

    # puppet resource service puppet ensure=running enable=true
