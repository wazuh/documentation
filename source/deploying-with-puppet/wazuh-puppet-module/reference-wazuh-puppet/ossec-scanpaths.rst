Scan paths configuration
========================

Leaving this unconfigured will result in Wazuh using the module defaults.

By default, it will monitor ``/etc``, ``/usr/bin``, ``/usr/sbin``, ``/bin`` and ``/sbin`` on the Wazuh Server, with real time monitoring disabled and report_changes enabled.

To overwrite the defaults or add in new paths to scan, you can use this variable at the manifest.

More information in about syscheck configuration in the :ref:`File integrity monitoring <fim-examples>` section.

To tell Wazuh to enable real time monitoring of the default paths:

wazuh::manager::ossec_scanpaths:
--------------------------------

  path: /etc report_changes: 'no' realtime: 'no'

  path: /usr/bin report_changes: 'no' realtime: 'no'

  path: /usr/sbin report_changes: 'no' realtime: 'no'

  path: /bin report_changes: 'yes' realtime: 'yes'

  path: /sbin report_changes: 'yes' realtime: 'yes'

wazuh::manager::ossec_ignorepaths:
----------------------------------

By default, it will be empty.

More information in about syscheck configuration in the :ref:`File integrity monitoring <fim-examples>` section.

.. note::
  Configuring the ossec_scanpaths variable will overwrite the default paths. If you want to add a new directory to monitor, you must also add the above default paths to be monitored as well.
