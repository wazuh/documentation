Monitoring Amazon Web Services (AWS)
====================================

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a widely used cloud computing platform provided by Amazon. It offers a broad set of services, including computing power, storage, databases, machine learning, analytics, security, and more. AWS enables individuals, businesses, and organizations to access and utilize computing resources without the need to invest in and maintain physical infrastructure.
