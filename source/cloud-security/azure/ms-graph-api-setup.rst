Microsoft Graph API setup
=========================

Wazuh must be authorized before it can pull logs and other content from the Microsoft Graph API. This authentication process is possible using the ``tenant_id``, ``client_id``, and ``secret_value`` of an authorized application, which we will register through Azure.

Registering your app
--------------------

#. Register an application to authenticate with the Microsoft identity platform endpoint.

      :align: center
      :width: 80%

#. Fill in the name of your app, choose the desired **account type**, and click on the **Register** button:

   .. thumbnail:: /images/cloud-security/ms-graph/register-application.png
      :align: center
      :width: 80%

The app is now registered; you can see information about it in its **Overview** section. Make sure to note down the ``client_id`` and ``tenant_id`` information:

   :align: center
   :width: 80%

Certificates & secrets
----------------------

#. Generate a secret you will use for the authentication process. Go to **Certificates & secrets** and click on **New client secret**, which will then generate the secret and its ID:

#. Ensure to copy and save the ``secret_value`` information:

      :width: 80%

   .. note::

      Ensure you write down the secret's value section because the UI won't let you copy it afterward.

API permissions
---------------

Your application needs specific API permissions to retrieve logs and events from the Microsoft Graph API.

To configure the application permissions, go to the **API permissions** page and choose **Add a permission**.

#. Select **Microsoft Graph API** and click on **Application permissions**.
#. Add the following relationships' permissions under the **SecurityAlert** and **SecurityIncident** sections:

   -  ``SecurityAlert.Read.All``: This permission is required to read security alerts from the ``/security/alerts_v2`` API on your tenant.
   -  ``SecurityIncident.Read.All``: This permission is required to read security incident data, including associated events/alerts from the ``/security/incidents`` API on your tenant.

      :width: 80%

   .. note::

      Admin consent is required for API permission changes.

Wazuh server or agent
---------------------

Next, we will see the necessary configuration to allow the integration to successfully pull logs from the Microsoft Graph API.

#. Apply the following configuration to the local configuration file ``/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf``:

   .. code-block:: xml

      <ms-graph>
          <enabled>yes</enabled>
          <only_future_events>yes</only_future_events>
          <curl_max_size>10M</curl_max_size>
          <run_on_start>yes</run_on_start>
          <interval>5m</interval>
          <version>v1.0</version>
          <api_auth>
            <client_id>your_client_id</client_id>
            <tenant_id>your_tenant_id</tenant_id>
            <secret_value>your_secret_value</secret_value>
            <api_type>global</api_type>
          </api_auth>
          <resource>
            <name>security</name>
            <relationship>alerts_v2</relationship>
            <relationship>incidents</relationship>
          </resource>
      </ms-graph>

   In this case, we will search for ``alerts_v2`` and incidents within the security resource at an interval of ``5m``. The logs will only be created after the Wazuh module for Microsoft Graph starts.

   Where:

   -  ``<client_id>`` (also known as an Application ID) is the unique identifier of your registered application.
   -  ``<tenant_id>`` (also known as Directory ID) is the unique identifier for your Azure tenant
   -  ``<secret_value>`` is the value of the client secret. It is used to authenticate the registered app on the Azure tenant.
   -  ``<api_type>`` specifies the type of Microsoft 365 subscription plan the tenant uses. global refers to either a commercial or GCC tenant.
   -  ``<name>`` specifies the resource's name (i.e., specific API endpoint) to query for logs.
   -  ``<relationship>`` specifies the types of content (relationships) to obtain logs for.

   .. note::

      Multi-tenant is not supported. You can only configure one block of ``api_auth``. To learn more about the Wazuh module for Microsoft Graph options, see the :doc:`ms-graph </user-manual/reference/ossec-conf/ms-graph-module>` reference.

Use case
--------

Using the configuration mentioned above, we examine a malicious email as an example of a security event.

Monitoring security resources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

One of the more ubiquitous alerts that an organization of any size receives is spam emails. In this case, we can specifically examine an example of a spam email containing malicious content and examine how Microsoft Graph & Wazuh report on this information.

We can set up the Wazuh module for Microsoft Graph to monitor the security resource and the ``alerts_v2`` relationship within our Microsoft 365 tenant described in :ref:`Retrieving content <retrieving_content>`. We also enable **Microsoft Defender for Office 365** within the Microsoft 365 tenant. Microsoft Defender for Office 365 monitors email messages for threats such as spam and malicious attachments.

Detect malicious email
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Enable Microsoft Defender for Office 365 and send a malicious email to an email address in the monitored domain. A malicious email detection activity will produce a log that can be accessed using the ``alerts_v2`` relationship within the Microsoft 365 tenant.

#. Login to `Microsoft 365 Defender portal <https://security.microsoft.com/>`__ using an admin account.
#. Navigate to **Policies & rules** > **Threat policies** > **Preset Security Policies**.
#. Toggle the **Standard protection is off** button under **Standard protection**.
#. Click on **Manage protection settings** and follow the prompt to set up the policies.

When Microsoft Defender for Office 365 detects a malicious email event, a log similar to the following is generated. You can view this event using the **Alerts** tab of the Microsoft Defender for Office 365 page:

   .. code-block:: none
      :class: output

      {
          "id":"xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx",

      }


The Wazuh module for Microsoft Graph retrieves this log via Microsoft Graph API. This log matches an out-of-the-box rule with ID ``99506``. This triggers an alert with the following details:
