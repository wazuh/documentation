  :description: The Wazuh module for GitHub enables the collection of audit logs from GitHub through its API. Check out this section of our documentation to learn more about it.

Monitoring GitHub audit logs
============================

Organizational administrators proactively utilize GitHub audit logs to review the actions performed by members within their organization. It includes details such as the user who performs the action, the nature of the action, and the timestamp of its execution. The Wazuh module for GitHub enables the collection of audit logs from GitHub through its API. Wazuh initiates an HTTP GET request to GitHub API endpoint ``/orgs/{org}/audit-log`` to collect the audit logs. For further details, you can refer to the `GitHub REST API <https://docs.github.com/en/rest>`__ documentation.

Requirements for monitoring GitHub audit logs
---------------------------------------------

You need the following requirements on GitHub to access the audit logs with Wazuh.

-  **GitHub organization**: You can only view audit logs for GitHub organizations.
-  **GitHub Enterprise Cloud subscription**: Only organizations with a GitHub Enterprise Cloud subscription can use the GitHub audit log REST API.

Creating a personal access token on GitHub
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Take the following steps on GitHub to generate the required personal access token:

#. Sign into GitHub with an account that belongs to the organization owner.
#. Navigate to https://github.com/settings/tokens/new to create a new personal access token.
#. Include a descriptive note for the personal access token, and select an expiration time.

Configure Wazuh to pull GitHub logs
-----------------------------------

Perform the following steps to allow Wazuh to monitor, collect, and analyze the GitHub audit logs. You can either configure the Wazuh module for GitHub in the Wazuh server or the Wazuh agent.

#. Append the following configuration to the ``/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf`` file on the Wazuh server.

   .. code-block:: xml

      <ossec_config>
        <github>
          <enabled>yes</enabled>
          <interval>1m</interval>
          <time_delay>1m</time_delay>
          <curl_max_size>1M</curl_max_size>
          <only_future_events>yes</only_future_events>
          <api_auth>
            <org_name><ORG_NAME></org_name>
            <api_token><API_TOKEN></api_token>
          </api_auth>
          <api_parameters>
            <event_type>all</event_type>
          </api_parameters>
        </github>
      </ossec_config>

   Where:

   -  ``<enabled>``: Enables the Wazuh module for GitHub. The allowed values are ``yes`` and ``no``.
   -  ``<interval>``: Defines the time interval between each execution of the Wazuh module for GitHub. The default value is ``10m``, and the allowed value is any positive number that contains a suffix character indicating a time unit, such as s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), and d (days). 
   -  ``<time_delay>``: Specifies the delay time of the scan with respect to the current time. The default value is ``30s``, and the allowed value is any positive number that contains a suffix character indicating a time unit, such as s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), and d (days).
   -  ``<curl_max_size>``: Specifies the maximum size allowed for the GitHub API response. The default value is ``1M``, and the allowed value is any positive number that contains a suffix character indicating a size unit, such as b/B (bytes), k/K (kilobytes), m/M (megabytes), and g/G (gigabytes).
   -  ``<only_future_events>``: When set to yes, the Wazuh module for GitHub collects only events generated after you start the Wazuh manager. when set to ``no``, it collects previous events generated before you start the Wazuh manager. The default value is ``yes``, and the allowed values are ``yes`` and ``no``.
   -  ``<api_auth>``: This block configures the credential for the authentication with the GitHub REST API. The following tags ``<org_name>`` and ``<api_token>`` are configuration tags within ``<api_auth>``.

      -  ``<org_name>``: Name of your GitHub organization. The allowed value is any string.
      -  ``<api_token>``: Personal access token to authenticate with the GitHub API. The allowed value is any string.
   -  ``<api_parameters>``: This block configures the internal options in the GitHub REST API. One sub-configuration block within ``<api_parameters>`` is ``<event_type>``.

      -  ``<event_type>``: Specifies the event types Wazuh should collect. The available event types are web and git events. The default value for this configuration block is ``all``, to collect both web and git events. Allowed values are ``all``, ``web``, and ``git``.

   To learn more about the configuration options, refer to the :doc:`Wazuh module for GitHub </user-manual/reference/ossec-conf/github-module>` reference.

#. Restart the Wazuh manager or agent service to apply the changes:

   -  **Wazuh manager**

      .. code-block:: console

         # systemctl restart wazuh-manager

   -  **Wazuh agent**

      .. code-block:: console

         # systemctl restart wazuh-agent

Monitor multiple GitHub organizations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can monitor multiple GitHub organizations with Wazuh by specifying the organization credentials in individual ``<api_auth>`` sections. For example, the following configuration monitors two organizations named ``organization1`` and ``organization2``.

.. code-block:: xml
   :emphasize-lines: 8-11, 13-16

   <github>
     <enabled>yes</enabled>
     <interval>1m</interval>
     <time_delay>1m</time_delay>
     <curl_max_size>1M</curl_max_size>
     <only_future_events>no</only_future_events>

     <api_auth>
       <org_name>organization1</org_name>
       <api_token><API_TOKEN></api_token>
     </api_auth>

     <api_auth>
       <org_name>organization2</org_name>
       <api_token><API_TOKEN></api_token>
     </api_auth>

     <api_parameters>
       <event_type>git</event_type>
     </api_parameters>
   </github>

Where:

-  ``<API_TOKEN>`` is the GitHub personal access token created within the ``admin:org`` scope.

Use case
--------

Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Integrate Wazuh with GitHub according to the :doc:`monitoring GitHub activity </cloud-security/github/monitoring-github-activity>` documentation.
-  An Ubuntu 23.10 endpoint with curl installed.

GitHub
^^^^^^

Create a GitHub personal access token within the ``admin:org``, ``repo``, and ``delete_repo`` scopes. We will use this token with the GitHub REST API to test the use cases by performing actions on the organization that trigger alerts on Wazuh. Take the following steps to create the token:

#. Navigate to https://github.com/settings/tokens/new, add a note for the token, select your desired expiration time, and then select the ``repo`` and the ``admin:org`` scopes.
