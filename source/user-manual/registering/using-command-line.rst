Registering agents using the command line (CLI)
===============================================

This method consists of registering the agents manually in the Wazuh manager using ``manage_agents`` binary, extracting the key and inserting it in the Wazuh agents using ``manage_agents`` too.

This method is completely manual and requires root access (or Administrator access in Windows) to the Wazuh managers and Wazuh agents.
