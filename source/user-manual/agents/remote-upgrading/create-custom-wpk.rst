Creating custom WPK packages
============================

1. Get a X509 certificate and CA
--------------------------------

Create root CA
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: console

    # openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout wpk_root.key -out wpk_root.pem -batch

Create a certificate and key
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: console

    # openssl req -new -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout wpkcert.key -out wpkcert.csr -subj '/C=US/ST=CA/O=Wazuh'

Set the location as follows:

    - /C=US is the country.
    - /ST=CA is the state.
    - /O=Wazuh is the organization's name.

Sign this certificate with the root CA
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: console

    # openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in wpkcert.csr -CA wpk_root.pem -CAkey wpk_root.key -out wpkcert.pem -CAcreateserial

2. Compile a package
--------------------

WPK packages will generally contain the complete agent code, however, this is not required.

A WPK package must contain an installation program in binary form or a script in any language supported by the agent (Bash, Python, etc). Canonical WPK packages must contain a Bash script named ``upgrade.sh`` for UNIX or ``upgrade.bat`` for Windows. This program must:

    * fork itself, as the parent will return 0 immediately,
    * restart the agent, and
    * the installer must write a file called upgrade_result containing a status number (0 means OK) before exiting.

Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * Python 2.7 or 3.5+
    * Cryptography package for Python. This may be obtained using the following:

    .. code-block:: console

        pip install cryptography

Canonical WPK package example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Download the sources from GitHub branch 3.2:

.. code-block:: console

    # curl -Lo wazuh-3.4.zip https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh/archive/3.4.zip && unzip wazuh-3.4.zip

2. Modify the ``wazuh-3.2/etc/preloaded-vars.conf`` file that was downloaded to deploy an :ref:`unattended update <unattended-installation>` in the agent by uncommenting the following lines:

.. code-block:: console

    USER_LANGUAGE="en"
    USER_NO_STOP="y"
    USER_UPDATE="y"

3. Compile the project:

.. code-block:: console

    # make -C wazuh-3.2/src TARGET=agent

4. Change to the base directory:

.. code-block:: console

    # cd wazuh-3.2

5. Install the root CA if you want to overwrite the root CA with the file you created previously:

.. code-block:: console

    # cp path/to/wpk_root.pem etc/wpk_root.pem

6. Compile the WPK package using your SSL certificate and key:

.. code-block:: console

    # contrib/agent-upgrade/wpkpack.py output/myagent.wpk path/to/wpkcert.pem path/to/wpkcert.key *

Definitions:
    - **output/myagent.wpk** is the name of the output WPK package.
    - **path/to/wpkcert.pem** is the path to your SSL certificate.
    - **path/to/wpkcert.key** is the path to your SSL certificate's key.
    - **\*** is the file (or the files) to be included into the WPK package.

In this example, the Wazuh Project's root directory contains the proper ``upgrade.sh`` file.

.. note::
    This is only an example. If you want to distribute a WPK package using this method, it's important to begin with an empty directory.
