Testing decoders and rules
===============================

The tool *ossec-logtest* allow us to test how an event is decoded and if an alert is generated.

Run the tool */var/ossec/bin/ossec-logtest* and paste the following log::

    Mar  8 22:39:13 ip-10-0-0-10 sshd[2742]: Accepted publickey for root from 73.189.131.56 port 57516


.. code-block:: console

    $ /var/ossec/bin/ossec-logtest

.. code-block:: none
    :class: output

           Description: 'sshd: authentication success.'
    **Alert to be generated.

.. warning::

    The decoder name showed in *Phase 2* will be the name of the parent decoder.


In addition, you can use the option "-v" to show more information about the rules:

.. code-block:: console

    $ /var/ossec/bin/ossec-logtest -v

.. code-block:: none
    :class: output
