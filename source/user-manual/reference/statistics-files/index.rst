Statistics files
================

The **statistics files** are useful to troubleshoot some problems you may encounter like not receiving enough alerts, agents not sending any events to the manager, a flooded agent's buffer, etc. You can also make use of these statistics to have a better perspective of your environment and how's everything working.

Currently, Wazuh provides three statistical files, listed below.
