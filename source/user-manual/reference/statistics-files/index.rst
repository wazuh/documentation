Statistics files
================

The **statistics files** are usefull to troubleshoot some problems you may encounter like not receiving enough alerts, the agent is not sending any events,
the agent's buffer is flooded... Also, you can use them to have a better perspective of your environment and how everything works.

Currently, Wazuh provides three statistical files:

- :doc:`Agentd state file<ossec-agentd-state>`
- :doc:`Remoted state file<ossec-remoted-state>`
- :doc:`Analysisd state file<ossec-analysisd-state>`
