ossec-remoted state file
========================

The statistical file for **ossec-remoted** is ``ossec-remoted.state`` and it's located in the Wazuh installation directory (``/var/ossec/var/run/ossec-remoted.state``).

This file provides information about the **ossec-remoted** daemon like the queue size, discarded messages or the number of TCP sessions among others. By default, this file is updated **every 5 seconds** but this interval can be changed with the ``remoted.state_interval`` variable in the ``internal_options.conf`` file. For further information, visit the :ref:`internal configuration <reference_internal_options>` page.

.. note:: The ``ossec-remoted.state`` statistical file is only available in managers.

.. note::
    This file is created automatically when an agent connects for the first time to the manager.
    If the manager had never an agent connected to it, this file won't exist.
