ossec-agentd.state
==================

The statistical file for **ossec-agentd** is located at ``/var/ossec/var/run/ossec-agentd.state``.

This file provides information about the agent as the number of generated events, last connection, agent status and some other useful information. 

By default, this file is updated every 5 seconds. This interval can be changed by modifying the ``agent.state_interval`` value from the :ref:`internal configuration <reference_internal_options>` file.

.. note::
    
    This file is created the first time the agent connects to the manager.

Below there is an example of the content of the file:
