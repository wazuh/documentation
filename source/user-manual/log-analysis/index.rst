Log analysis
================

Log Analysis is the real time process to make sense out of the records generated by servers or devices. This component can receive logs through: files, Windows event log or receive them by remote syslog, forwarding them to a central manager for analysis and storage.
The purpose of this process is the identification of application or system errors, misconfigurations, intrusion attempts, policy violations or security issues.

The memory and CPU usage of the agent is insignificant because it only forwards events to the manager, however on the master CPU and memory consumption can increase quickly depending on the events per second (EPS) that the master has to analyze.
