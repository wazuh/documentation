Integration with external APIs
==============================

The *Integrator* daemon allows Wazuh to connect to external APIs and alerting tools such as Slack, PagerDuty, VirusTotal, Shuffle, and Maltiverse.

Configuration
-------------

The integrations are configured on the Wazuh manager ``ossec.conf`` file. You can find this file in the Wazuh installation folder ``/var/ossec/etc/``. To configure an integration, add the following configuration within the ``<ossec_config>`` section:

.. code-block:: xml

  <integration>
    <name> </name>
    <hook_url> </hook_url> <!-- Required for Slack, Shuffle, and Maltiverse -->
    <api_key> </api_key> <!-- Required for PagerDuty, VirusTotal, and Maltiverse -->
    <alert_format>json</alert_format> <!-- Required for Slack, PagerDuty, VirusTotal, Shuffle, and Maltiverse -->

    <!-- Optional filters -->
    <rule_id> </rule_id>
    <level> </level>
    <group> </group>
    <event_location> </event_location>

    <!-- Optional settings -->
    <max_log> </max_log>
    <options> </options>
    <timeout> </timeout>
    <retries> </retries>
  </integration>


After enabling the daemon and configuring the integrations, restart the Wazuh manager to apply the changes:

.. include:: /_templates/common/restart_manager.rst


Optional filters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `Integrator` daemon uses the `optional filters` fields to determine which alerts should be sent to the external platforms. Only the alerts that meet the filter conditions are sent. If no filters are specified, all alerts are sent.

The following considerations must be taken into account when the filters are set:

   - It is possible to specify multiple group names using the ``<group>`` field with a comma-separated list. If the alert's group matches any of the groups in the list, the alert is sent. Otherwise, it is ignored.
   - It is possible to specify multiple rule IDs using the ``<rule_id>`` field with a comma-separated list. If the alert's rule ID matches any of the IDs in the list, the alert is sent. Otherwise, it is ignored.
   - It is possible to specify the previously described fields together. If both the alert's rule ID and group match any of the IDs and groups in the lists, the alert is sent. Otherwise, it is ignored.

.. note::
  It is recommended to carefully check the groups and rule identifiers mentioned above, as defining them incorrectly will result in expected alerts not being sent to the integration.

You can find the full configuration reference for the Integrator daemon in the :ref:`Integration <reference_ossec_integration>` section of our Reference guide.

Optional settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `Integrator` daemon uses the `optional settings` fields to tailor the integration behavior.

.. _slack_manual_integration:

Slack
-----

This integration uses Slack Incoming Webhooks and allows posting Wazuh alerts into a Slack channel.

To set up this integration, follow these steps.

#. Enable Incoming Webhooks and create one for your Slack channel. Follow the Slack guide on `Incoming Webhooks <https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks>`__ for this.

#. Edit ``/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf`` in the Wazuh server and include a configuration block such as the following. Replace ``WEBHOOK_URL`` with your Incoming Webhook URL.

   .. code-block:: xml

     <integration>
       <name>slack</name>
       <hook_url>WEBHOOK_URL</hook_url> <!-- Replace with your Slack hook URL -->
       <alert_format>json</alert_format>
     </integration>

   .. note::

      You can set a JSON object with customization fields using the ``options`` tag. Visit the `Slack API reference <https://api.slack.com/reference/messaging/attachments#legacy_fields>`__ for information about available customization fields.

#. Restart the Wazuh manager to apply the changes.

   .. include:: /_templates/common/restart_manager.rst

Once the configuration is complete, alerts start showing in the selected channel.

`PagerDuty <https://www.pagerduty.com/>`_ is a SaaS incident response platform suitable for IT departments. The Pagerduty integration uses the Pagerduty API to forward Wazuh alerts to its Incidents Dashboard.

To set up this integration, do the following.

#. Get your own *Events API v2* integration key by creating a `Pagerduty new service <https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/services-and-integrations#create-a-service>`__.

#. Edit ``/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf`` in the Wazuh server and include a configuration block such as the following. Replace ``API_KEY`` with your Pagerduty integration key. The rule level filter is optional and you can remove it or set another level value for the integration.

   .. code-block:: xml
      :emphasize-lines: 3

      <integration>
        <name>pagerduty</name>
        <api_key>API_KEY</api_key> <!-- Replace with your PagerDuty API key -->
        <level>10</level>
        <alert_format>json</alert_format> <!-- New mandatory parameter since v4.7.0 -->
      </integration>

   .. note::

      You can set a JSON object with customization fields using the ``options`` tag. Visit the `PagerDuty API reference <https://developer.pagerduty.com/docs/ZG9jOjExMDI5NTgx-send-an-alert-event>`__ for information about available customization fields.

#. Restart the Wazuh manager to apply the changes.

   .. include:: /_templates/common/restart_manager.rst

Once the configuration is complete, alerts start showing on the Pagerduty dashboard.
