Deploying a Wazuh cluster
=========================

.. versionadded:: 3.0.0

The Wazuh cluster functionality has been developed to strengthen the communication between agents and managers. The cluster can synchronize events between its nodes to allow agents to report events to any manager that is a part of the cluster.

Why do we need a Wazuh cluster?
-------------------------------

The Wazuh cluster provides horizontal scalability to the Wazuh environment, allowing agents to report to any manager belonging to the cluster. This enables Wazuh to process a greater number of events than with a single manager environment as the cluster distributes the load between multiple managers simultaneously.

Additionally, a cluster of Wazuh managers provides a level of fault tolerance so that if one manager goes off-line, Wazuh can continue operating so long as the master manager is still accessible. To accomplish this, agents that were reporting to a manager that goes off-line will automatically be redirected to another manager in the cluster without losing events. This functionality dramatically increases the availability and efficiency of the Wazuh environment.

Please note, however, that the cluster functionality does not provide automated load balancing. We recommend that a load balancer be configured between agents and the cluster nodes. With a load balancer in place, the agents would be configured to use the IP address of the load balancer as their manager IP address.

The Wazuh cluster is under further development and we hope to include many additional features very soon, including switching the role of master between all managers to provide even greater availability and fault tolerance.

How it works
------------

The Wazuh cluster is managed by a cluster daemon which communicates with the managers following a master-client architecture.

.. note::
  The date and time must be synchronized between all managers in the cluster. This can be done using the `NTP (Network Time Protocol) <https://wiki.debian.org/NTP>`_.

Master
^^^^^^

The master node is the manager that controls the cluster. The configuration of the master node is pushed to the other managers which allows for the centralization of the following:

- agent registration,
- agent deletion,
- rules, decoders and CDB lists synchronization,
- configuration of agents grouping, and
- centralized configuration of the ``agent.conf`` file used by the agents within each agent group.

The master node sends to its clients the complete ``etc/shared`` directory contained in its Wazuh installation directory.  This includes the centralized configuration of agents ordered by groups and the ``client.keys`` file. These shared files allow agents to report to any manager of the cluster.

Before sending rules and decoders, the master node runs ``ossec-logtest`` to verify the pending rules/decoders to push are correct. This check is also done in the clients when rules, decoders or CDB lists are received. If ``ossec-logtest`` runs doesn't report any error, the client manager is restarted. **The** ``ossec.conf`` **file is not synchronized.** If any rule or decoder is excluded in the master's ``ossec.conf``, it should be synchronized manually. Otherwise, the ``ossec-logtest`` check will fail on the client and it won't be restarted.

The communication between the nodes of the cluster is performed by means of a self-developed protocol.  This synchronization occurs at the frequency defined in the ``<cluster>`` section of :doc:`Local configuration <../reference/ossec-conf/cluster>`. These cluster communications are sent with the AES encryption algorithm providing for security and confidentiality.

Client
^^^^^^

Cluster managers that have the client role update their files with the data received from the master node. This ensures that the shared configuration for the agents is the same in all managers.

Client nodes send the ``agent-info`` file of their reporting agents to the master. This file contains important information about each agent and allows the master node to have real-time awareness of the connection status of all agents and the manager that each agent is reporting to.

Cluster daemons
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Wazuh clusters function through the use of the following two daemons:

- **wazuh-clusterd** which synchronizes the managers in the cluster and outputs a logfile to ``logs/cluster.log``, and

- **wazuh-clusterd-internal** which monitors the files to synchronize and manages the cluster database. The logs of this daemon can be found in the ``logs/ossec.log`` file.

Both of these daemons must be running in all the managers of the cluster. The **wazuh-clusterd** will automatically start the **wazuh-clusterd-internal** daemon.

Refer to the :doc:`Daemons <../reference/daemons/index>` section for more information about the use of these daemons.

Cluster management
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The cluster can be efficiently controlled from any manager with the **cluster_control** tool. This tool allows you to obtain real-time information about any node, the status of the synchronized files and information about agents connected to the cluster.

The manual for this tool can be found at :doc:`cluster_control tool <../reference/tools/cluster_control>`.

Cluster database
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The cluster database has been incorporated into the database for each manager in the cluster.  This database is called ``cluster.db`` and contains information about the syncronization status of the files. Each row of the database contains the ``<node> <file> <state>`` fields.


Use case: Deploying a Wazuh cluster
-----------------------------------

.. note::
  To run the wazuh-clusterd binary, **Python 2.7** is required. If your OS has a previous python version, please refer to `Run the cluster in CentOS 6`_ for instructions on how to update to and use **Python 2.7**.

Follow these steps to deploy a Wazuh cluster:

1. Install dependencies

  a. For RPM-based distributions:

    .. code-block:: console

      # yum install python-setuptools python-cryptography

  b. For Debian-based distributions:

    .. code-block:: console

      # apt install python-cryptography

2. Set the configurtion of the managers of the cluster.

  In the ``<cluster>`` section of the :doc:`Local configuration <../reference/ossec-conf/cluster>`, set the configuration for the cluster as below:

  - Designate one manager as the master and the rest as clients under the ``<node_type>`` field.
  - The key must be 32 characters long and should be the same for all of the nodes of the cluster. Use the following command to generate a random password:

      .. code-block:: console

          # openssl rand -hex 16

  - The IP addresses of all of the **nodes** of the cluster must be specified under ``<nodes>``, including the IP address of the local manager. The managers will use the bash command ``hostname --all-ip-addresses`` to find out which IP address from the list is theirs. If the ``hostname --all-ip-addresses`` command finds there is a duplicate IP address, an error will be displayed.

  The following is an example of this configuration:

  .. code-block:: xml

      <cluster>
        <name>cluster01</name>
        <node_name>manager_centos</node_name>
        <node_type>master</node_type>
        <key>nso42FGdswR0805tnVqeww0u3Rubwk2a</key>
        <interval>2m</interval>
        <port>1516</port>
        <bind_addr>0.0.0.0</bind_addr>
        <nodes>
          <node>192.168.0.3</node>
          <node>192.168.0.4</node>
          <node>192.168.0.5</node>
        </nodes>
        <hidden>no</hidden>
        <disabled>yes</disabled>
      </cluster>

3. To enable the Wazuh cluster, set ``<disabled>`` to ``no`` in the ``<cluster>`` section of the ossec.conf file and restart:

    .. code-block:: console

        # /var/ossec/bin/ossec-control restart

4. The cluster should now be synchronized with the same shared files in all managers.

.. _run-cluster-centos6:

Run the cluster in CentOS 6
---------------------------
Python 2.6 is the default python version in CentOS 6. Since Python 2.7 is required to run the cluster, follow these steps to install and use this version:

1. Install Python 2.7 as follows:
  
  .. code-block:: console

    # yum install -y centos-release-scl
    # yum install -y python27

2. Install the Python package ``cryptography`` via pip:

  .. code-block:: console

    # export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/rh/python27/root/usr/lib64:/opt/rh/python27/root/usr/lib
    # /opt/rh/python27/root/usr/bin/pip2.7 install cryptography

3. Since the cluster doesn't use the default python version in CentOS 6, the service file should be modified to load the correct python version when ``wazuh-manager`` service starts:

  .. code-block:: console

     # sed -i 's#echo -n "Starting OSSEC: "#echo -n "Starting OSSEC (EL6): "; source /opt/rh/python27/enable; export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/var/ossec/framework/lib#' /etc/init.d/wazuh-manager

4. Use ``service`` command instead of ``/var/ossec/bin/ossec-control`` to start, stop and restart Wazuh:

  .. code-block:: console

    # service wazuh-manager restart
    Stopping OSSEC:                                            [  OK  ]
    Starting OSSEC (EL6):                                      [  OK  ]

5. Finally, check the cluster is running:

  .. code-block:: console

    # ps aux | grep cluster
    ossec     9714  0.1  1.3 136572 14140 ?        S    14:22   0:00 python /var/ossec/bin/wazuh-clusterd
    root      9718  0.0  0.4 176044  4700 ?        Ssl  14:22   0:00 /var/ossec/bin/wazuh-clusterd-internal -tmaster
    ossec     9720  0.0  1.2 220256 12988 ?        Sl   14:22   0:00 python /var/ossec/bin/wazuh-clusterd
    ossec     9725  0.1  1.3 137364 14216 ?        S    14:22   0:00 python /var/ossec/bin/wazuh-clusterd
    root      9767  0.0  0.0 103340   904 pts/0    S+   14:22   0:00 grep cluster
