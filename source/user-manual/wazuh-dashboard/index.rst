Wazuh dashboard
===============

The Wazuh dashboard is a powerful web user interface for data visualization and analysis. It includes out-of-the-box dashboards for security events, regulatory compliance (e.g., PCI DSS, GDPR, CIS, HIPAA, NIST 800-53), detected vulnerable applications, file integrity monitoring data, configuration assessment results, cloud infrastructure monitoring events, and others. It is also used to manage the Wazuh configuration and to monitor its status.
