Filtering data using queries
============================

The query language to use depends on where the data is coming from:

- Wazuh API
- Wazuh indexer

Wazuh API queries
-----------------

The WQL search bars found in various sections of the Wazuh dashboard, use the Wazuh Query Language to query the API. This language is based on the :ref:`Wazuh API query language <queries>`.

There are two query modes:

- :ref:`explicit <explicit_queries>`: The search contains a field, an operator, and a value.

- :ref:`search term <search_term_queries>`: Uses a term to search in the available fields.

.. _explicit_queries:

Explicit queries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These queries include a field, an operator and a value. This mode is activated when both a field value and an operator are present.

   - **Field name**: Field name to filter by. If an incorrect field name is used, a validation error is displayed.

   - **Operator**: Operator to filter by. The available operators are:

      - ``=``: equality.
      - ``!=``: not equality.
      - ``<``: smaller.
      - ``>``: bigger.
      - ``~``: like as.
      - ``()``: grouping operators. Group queries.

   - **Value**: Value to filter by.

      - For values without spaces, no additional formatting is necessary.
      - Values with spaces or containing the double quote character ``"`` must be wrapped by a pair of double quotes ``""``. The double quote ``"`` can be escaped using ``\"``. For example, ``"value with whitespaces and escaped \"quotes\""``.

   - **Separator**: Operator to join multiple "queries".

      - ``or``: represents an ``OR``.
      - ``and``: represents an ``AND``.
    
    .. note::

        The tokens can be separated by whitespaces.

.. _search_term_queries:

Search term queries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use a term to search in the available fields. Under the hood, this search is translated to query in each field supported by the explicit mode using the like as operator ``~``.

.. warning::

    The explicit and search term modes can't be combined.


Query examples
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Explicit mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Filter by entities whose ``id`` is equal to a specific value:

   .. code-block:: none

      id=001

   .. note::
      :class: not-long

      It is possible to use whitespaces between the tokens.

      .. code-block:: none

         id = 001

To get more precise results, use a query with multiple statements using the logical operators ``and`` or ``or`` and grouping operators ``()``.


- Filter active agents whose ``os.platform`` contains Linux:

   .. code-block:: none

      status=active and os.platform~linux


- Filter agents whose status is not ``Never connected``, whose IP address contains ``240``, and whose operating system is Linux:

   .. code-block:: none

      status!=never_connected and ip~240 and os.platform~linux

- Filter agents whose status is not ``Never connected`` and whose IP address contains ``240``, or agents whose ``id`` is equal to ``001``:

   .. code-block:: none

      ( status!=never_connected and ip~240 ) or id=001


Search term mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Search the term ``linux`` in the available fields:

.. code-block:: none

    linux


Wazuh Indexer
-------------

In the Wazuh dashboard, there are specialized search bars for querying Wazuh indexer data. These use the same syntax as OpenSearch. To learn more, refer to `Using Dashboards Query Language <https://opensearch.org/docs/2.10/dashboards/discover/dql/>`__.
