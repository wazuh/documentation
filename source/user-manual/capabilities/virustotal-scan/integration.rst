How it works
============

This integration utilizes the VirusTotal API to detect malicious content within the files monitored by **File Integrity Monitoring**. This integration functions as described below:

1. FIM looks for any file addition, change or deletion on the monitored folders. This module stores the hash of this files and triggers alerts when any changes are made.

2. When the VirusTotal integration is enabled, it is triggered when a FIM alert occurs. From this alert, the module extracts the hash field of the file.

3. The module then makes an HTTP POST request to the VirusTotal database using the VirusTotal API for comparison between the extracted hash and the information contained in the database.

4. A JSON response is then received that is the result of this search which will trigger one of the following alerts:

   - Error: Public API request rate limit reached.
   - Error: Check credentials.
   - Alert: No records in VirusTotal database.
   - Alert: No positives found.
   - Alert: X engines detected this file.

The triggered alert is logged in the ``integration.log`` file and stored in the ``alerts.log`` file with all other alerts.

Find examples of these alerts in the `VirusTotal integration alerts`_ section below.

Use case: Scanning a file
-------------------------

Getting started
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Follow the instructions from :ref:`manual_integration` to enable the **Integrator** daemon, install the ``requests`` package and configure the VirusTotal integration.

This is an example configuration to add on the ``ossec.conf`` file:

.. code-block:: xml

  <integration>
    <name>virustotal</name>
    <api_key>API_KEY</api_key> <!-- Replace with your VirusTotal API key -->
    <group>syscheck</group>
    <alert_format>json</alert_format>
  </integration>

Using FIM to monitor a directory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For this use case, we will show how to monitor the folder ``/media/user/software`` with an agent.

1. The following must be added to the ``<syscheck>`` section of the configuration file:

  .. code-block:: xml

    <syscheck>
    ...
      <directories check_all="yes" realtime="yes">/media/user/software</directories>
    ...
    </syscheck>

2. After applying the configuration, you must restart the Wazuh manager:

  a. For Systemd:

    .. code-block:: console

      # systemctl restart wazuh-manager

  b. For SysV Init:

    .. code-block:: console

      # service wazuh-manager restart

After restarting, FIM will apply the new configuration and the specified folder will be monitored in real-time. The alert below appears when a file is added to the monitored directory:

.. code-block:: console
  :emphasize-lines: 4,10,11

  ** Alert 1510684983.55139: - ossec,syscheck,pci_dss_11.5,gpg13_4.11,

  New inode: 104062

From this alert, the integrator daemon extracts the hash fields, sending the request to VirusTotal for comparison.

VirusTotal integration alerts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When a request to VirusTotal is sent by the integrator module, as noted above, different alerts will be triggered depending on the situation. Below are examples and explanations of these alerts:

**The API credentials are incorrect:**

.. code-block:: console
  :emphasize-lines: 3

  ** Alert 1510676062.9653: - virustotal,
  2017 Nov 14 16:14:22 PC->virustotal
  Rule: 87102 (level 3) -> 'VirusTotal: Error: Check credentials'
  {"virustotal": {"description": "Error: Check credentials", "error": 403}, "integration": "virustotal"}
  virustotal.description: Error: Check credentials
  virustotal.error: 403
  integration: virustotal

This error means that the API key set in the configuration is invalid.

**The API has reached the set rate limit:**

.. code-block:: console
  :emphasize-lines: 3

  ** Alert 1510684990.60518: - virustotal,
  2017 Nov 14 18:43:10 PC->virustotal
  Rule: 87101 (level 3) -> 'VirusTotal: Error: Public API request rate limit reached'
  {"virustotal": {"description": "Error: Public API request rate limit reached", "error": 204}, "integration": "virustotal"}
  virustotal.description: Error: Public API request rate limit reached
  virustotal.error: 204
  integration: virustotal

This error is triggered when the request rate limit set by VirusTotal has been reached. See the :ref:`Terms of Service <virustotal-tos>` for more information on this limitation.

While the two previous alerts represent errors that may occur, the following are samples of alerts returned from a successful request:

**Alert received when there are no records in the VirusTotal database:**
