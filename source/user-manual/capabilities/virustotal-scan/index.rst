VirusTotal integration
======================

.. versionadded:: 3.0.0

From version 3.0.0, Wazuh incorporates a new integration which scans monitored files for malicious content.

This solution consists in an integration with VirusTotal, a powerful platform that aggreates many antivirus products and an online scanning engine.
Combining this tool with our FIM engine, we have a simple way to scan the monitored files by **syscheck** looking for any malicious content.
