Monitoring configuration changes
================================

Monitoring configuration changes helps to establish accountability for changes made to systems and applications. Organizations can identify responsible parties and ensure that changes are properly authorized and documented by maintaining a record of changes and who made them.

You can configure the FIM module to monitor configuration files and report any changes. The Wazuh FIM module uses the :ref:`whodata <who-data-monitoring>` and :ref:`report_changes <reporting-changes-in-registry-values>` attributes to record the following information about such changes:

- The login user that made the changes.
- The time of the changes.
- The process that the user executed.
- The changes made to the file.

Configuration
-------------

Perform the following steps to configure the FIM module to monitor the ``/etc/app.conf`` file and report changes.

#. Create a file ``app.conf`` in the ``/etc`` directory:

   .. code-block:: console

      # touch /etc/app.conf 

#. Edit the ``/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf`` configuration file and add the configuration below:

   .. code-block:: xml
      
      <syscheck>
        <directories check_all="yes" report_changes="yes" whodata="yes">/etc/app.conf</directories>
      </syscheck>

#. Restart the Wazuh agent to apply the configuration changes:

   .. code-block:: console

      systemctl restart wazuh-agent

Test the configuration
----------------------

#. Modify the ``/etc/app.conf`` file by using ``nano`` with root privilege:

   .. code-block:: console

      # nano /etc/app.conf

#. Add ``updated image to V2`` to the file and save.

Visualize the alert
-------------------

Navigate to **File Integrity Monitoring** on the Wazuh dashboard to view the alert generated when the FIM module detects modification of the configuration file.

Expand the alert to get more information about the event. In this example, the ``nano`` text editor modified the configuration file. The logged-in user on the endpoint was ``ubuntu``. The user modified the file using root privilege. The content added to the file is ``updated image to V2``.
