Interpreting the FIM module analysis
====================================

FIM analysis results appear on the Wazuh dashboard whenever there’s an addition, modification, or deletion of monitored files. You can view the FIM results in three different sections of the dashboard. To view results from the FIM module, navigate to **File Integrity Monitoring** on the Wazuh dashboard. The results are in the following sections:

- :ref:`Inventory <inventory>` 
- :ref:`Dashboard <dashboard>`
- :ref:`Events <events>`

This section displays an inventory of all files that the FIM module has indexed. The FIM database contains the inventory information including the filename, last modification date, user, user id, group, and file size. The image below shows the file inventory of an Ubuntu 20.04 endpoint.
