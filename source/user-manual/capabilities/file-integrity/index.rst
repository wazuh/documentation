File integrity monitoring
==========================

Wazuh's File integrity monitoring (FIM) system watches selected files, triggering alerts when these files are modified. The component responsible for this task is called **syscheck**. This component stores the cryptographic checksum and other attributes of a known good file or Windows registry key and regularly compares it to the current file being used by the system, watching for changes.
