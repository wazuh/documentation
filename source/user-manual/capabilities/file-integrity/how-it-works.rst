How it works
============

  :title: File integrity monitoring
  :align: center
  :width: 100%

1. The Wazuh agent scans the system and sends the checksums and attributes of monitored files and Windows registry keys to the Wazuh manager. The following options are configurable:

  - **Frequency**: By default, syscheck runs every 12 hours.
  - **Real-time monitoring**: Wazuh supports real-time file integrity monitoring on servers running Windows or Linux (Solaris does not support Inotify so is not available for this system). Note that the real-time option can only be used for directories and not for individual files.
  - **Whodata**: This feature works like real-time, in addition provides information about who triggered the event.

2. The Wazuh manager stores the checksums and attributes of the monitored files and looks for modifications by comparing the new values to the old values.

.. note:: **Syscheck** can be configured to report a diff summary of the actual changes made to text files.

3. An alert is generated any time that modifications are detected in the monitored files and/or registry keys.

  False positives can be addressed using the ``ignore`` configuration option or by creating rules that list files to be excluded from FIM alerts.
