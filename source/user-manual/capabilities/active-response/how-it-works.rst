When is an active response triggered?
-------------------------------------

An **active response** is a script that is configured to execute when a specific alert, alert level or rule group has been triggered.  Active responses are either stateful or stateless responses.  Stateful responses are configured to undo the action after a specified period of time while stateless responses are configured as one-time actions.

Where are active response actions executed?
-------------------------------------------

Each active response specifies where its associated command will be executed: on the agent that triggered the alert, on the manager, on another specified agent or on all agents, which also includes the manager(s).

Active response configuration
-----------------------------

Active responses are configured in the manager by modifying the :ref:`ossec.conf <reference_ossec_conf>` file as follows:

1. Create a command

	In order to configure an active response, a **command** must be defined that will initiate a certain script in response to a trigger.

	To configure the active response, define the name of a command using the pattern below and then reference the script to be initiated. Next, define what data element(s) will be passed to the script.

	Custom scripts that have the ability to receive parameters from the command line may also be used for an **active response**.

	Example::

		<command>
		  <name>host-deny</name>
		  <executable>host-deny.sh</executable>
		  <expect>srcip</expect>
		  <timeout_allowed>yes</timeout_allowed>
		</command>

	In this example, the command is called ``host-deny`` and initiates the ``host-deny.sh`` script.  The data element is defined as ``srcip``. This command is configured to allow a timeout after a specified period of time, making it a stateful response.

	.. note::
		More information and options to create a command here: :ref:`command <reference_ossec_commands>`

2. Define the **active response**

	The active response configuration defines when and where a command is going to be executed. A command will be triggered when a specific rule with a specific id, severity level or source matches the active response criteria.  This configuration will further define where the action of the command will be initiated, meaning in which environment (agent, manager, local, or everywhere).

	Example::

		<active-response>
		  <command>host-deny</command>
		  <location>local</location>
		  <level>7</level>
		  <timeout>600</timeout>
		</active-response>

	In this example, the active response is configured to execute the command that was defined in the previous step. The *where* of the action is defined as the local host and the *when* is defined as any time the rule has a level higher than 6.  The timeout that was allowed in the command configuration is also defined in the above example.

.. note::
