CIS-CAT integration
===================

.. versionadded:: 3.1.0

The **CIS-CAT wodle** has been developed for the purpose of integrating CIS benchmark assessments into Wazuh agents.

What is CIS-CAT
---------------

CIS (Center for Internet Security) is an entity dedicated to safeguard private and public organizations against cyber threats. This entity provides
CIS benchmarks guidelines, which are a recognized global standard and best practices for securing IT systems and data against cyberattacks.

In addition, CIS-CAT pro is a "cross-platform Java app" tool developed for scanning target systems and generating a report comparing the system settings to
the CIS benchmarks. There are more than 80 CIS benchmarks that cover nearly all OSs, providing different profiles depending on the specific need.

It is important to note that CIS-CAT pro is proprietary software which is required for the use of this integration.

How it works
------------

The CIS-CAT Wazuh module integrates CIS benchmark assessments into Wazuh agents and reports the results of each scan in the form of an alert.

CIS-CAT pro is written in Java, so it requires a Java Runtime Environment in order to execute it. Currently, the JRE versions supported in
CIS-CAT are JRE 6, 7, 8.

For running this integration, the CIS-CAT tool must reside on the local agent that runs the scans. However, the JRE can be located on
a removable disk or network drive for the purpose of sharing between multiple agents.

In addition, in Unix systems, the CIS-CAT script may need to be granted execute permissions. To do this, run the following command from the CIS-CAT directory:

.. code-block:: console

    # chmod +x CIS-CAT.sh

Once you have the requirements for running CIS evaluations, you can configure the wodle to check for specific benchmarks at a your chosen interval. The scan results from these checks are sent to the manager and can be included in the visualizations.

Use case: Running a CIS evaluation
----------------------------------

The following is an example of how to deploy the CIS-CAT integration:

1. In the configuration file, ``ossec.conf``, set up a section as follows:

  1.1 If you a using a UNIX environment:

  .. code-block:: xml

    <wodle name="cis-cat">

      <disabled>no</disabled>
      <timeout>1800</timeout>
      <interval>1d</interval>
      <scan-on-start>yes</scan-on-start>

      <java_path>/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-amd64/jre/bin</java_path>
      <ciscat_path>/var/ossec/wodles/ciscat</ciscat_path>

      <content type="xccdf" path="benchmarks/CIS_Ubuntu_Linux_16.04_LTS_Benchmark_v1.0.0-xccdf.xml">
        <profile>xccdf_org.cisecurity.benchmarks_profile_Level_2_-_Server</profile>
      </content>

    </wodle>


  1.2 If you a using a Windows environment:

  .. code-block:: xml
    
    <wodle name="cis-cat">
      <disabled>no</disabled>
      <timeout>1800</timeout>
      <interval>1d</interval>
      <scan-on-start>yes</scan-on-start>

      <java_path>\\server\jre\bin\java.exe</java_path>
      <ciscat_path>C:\cis-cat</ciscat_path>

      <content type="xccdf" path="benchmarks/your_windows_benchamark_file_xccdf.xml">
        <profile>xccdf_org.cisecurity.benchmarks_profile_Level_2_-_Server</profile>
      </content>

    </wodle>

.. note::
    Make sure the paths are correct for the location of your Java and the CIS-CAT tool and the path to the selected benchmark is relative to the CIS-CAT tool path.

    If no profile is specified, the first one, which is usually the most permissive, will be selected.

2. After restarting the Wazuh agent, the benchmark checks will be executed at the specified interval, triggering alerts as shown below.
