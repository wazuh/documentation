How it works
============

The `Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) <https://scap.nist.gov/>`_ is a specification for expressing and manipulating security data in standardized ways. SCAP uses several specifications in order to automate continuous monitoring, vulnerability management, and reporting the results of security compliance scans.

Components of the security compliance evaluation process:

  - **SCAP scanner**: This is an application that reads a SCAP policy and checks whether or not the system is compliant with it. There are many `tools <https://nvd.nist.gov/scapproducts.cfm>`_ to scan your systems against SCAP policies. This wodle is an integration with the NIST-certified scanner called **OpenSCAP**.

  - **Security policies (SCAP content)**: These determine how a system must be set up and what to check for. These policies contain machine-readable descriptions of the rules which your system will be required to follow.

  - **Profiles**: Each security policy can contain multiple profiles, which provide sets of rules and values in line with a specific security baseline. You can think of a profile as a particular subset of rules within the policy; the profile determines which rules defined in the policy will be actually used and what values will be used during the evaluation.

  - **Evaluation (scan)**: This is the process performed by the OpenSCAP scanner on an agent according to a specific security policy and profile.  It usually takes only a few minutes, depending on the number of rules selected in the profile.


Requirements
------------

This wodle is executed on the agent, so each agent must meet the following requirements:

    OpenSCAP
    In order to perform SCAP evaluations, we need the scanner. As we mentioned above, we use OpenSCAP. You can install it with this command:

      a) For RPM-based distributions:

        .. code-block:: console

          # yum install openscap-scanner

      b) For Debian-based distributions:

        .. code-block:: console

          # apt-get install libopenscap8 xsltproc

    Python 2.6+
    Python is a core part of this wodle. Currently all Linux distributions come with python, so it should not be an inconvenience.

The agent will run *openscap-scanner* periodically according to the configuration. Each result of the scan will be sent to the Manager and it will generate an alert if the status of the result is fail. It is possible to tuning the rules to send the pass result too.
