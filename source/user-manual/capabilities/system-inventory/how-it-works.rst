How it works
============

As mentioned above, the Wazuh agent uses the Syscollector module to gather relevant information from the monitored endpoint. Once the agent service starts on a monitored endpoint, the Syscollector module runs periodical scans and collects data on the system properties defined in your configuration. The data is first stored in a temporal local database on the endpoint. 

The agent forwards the newly collected data from its local database to the Wazuh server. Each agent uses a separate database on the Wazuh server. The Wazuh server updates the appropriate tables of the inventory database on the Wazuh server using the information the agent sends. For example, the Wazuh server stores hardware-related information in a table called ``sys_hwinfo``.

The Wazuh dashboard automatically displays the data stored in the inventory database. However, you can query the database using the Wazuh API or the ``SQLite`` tool. In addition, the :doc:`vulnerability detection </user-manual/capabilities/vulnerability-detection/index>` module uses :ref:`packages <syscollector_packages>` and :ref:`Windows updates <syscollector_hotfixes>` information in the inventory to detect vulnerable and patched software on monitored endpoints.
