Generating system inventory reports
===================================

You can generate two types of reports from the Wazuh dashboard. These reports are the property-specific report and the endpoint inventory report. 

Property-specific report
------------------------

This feature allows you to export ``CSV`` reports of a specific property of an endpoint. For example, you can generate a report of the installed software on an endpoint. This kind of report is only available for processes and installed software. 

To download this report, click on the **Download CSV** beneath the specific property you are interested in on the **Inventory data** page of the endpoint.

Endpoint inventory report
-------------------------

This feature allows you to export a full report of all endpoint properties collected by the Wazuh Syscollector module. This report is generated in PDF format and can serve a variety of uses. To download the full endpoint report:

- Click on **Generate Report** on the **Inventory data** page of the Wazuh agent.

- When the report is ready, navigate to **Indexer/dashboard management** > **Reporting** and download the report.

.. Note::
   Both report types cover the inventory for only the monitored endpoint of interest.
