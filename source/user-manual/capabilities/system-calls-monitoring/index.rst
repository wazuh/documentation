=======================

The `Linux Audit system <https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Security_Guide/chap-system_auditing.html>`_ provides a way to track security-relevant information on your machine. Based on preconfigured rules, Audit proves detailed real-time logging about the events that are happening on your system. This information is crucial for mission-critical environments to determine the violator of the security policy and the actions they performed.
