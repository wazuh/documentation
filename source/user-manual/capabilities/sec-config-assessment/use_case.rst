Use case: Getting an alert when a check changes its result value
================================================================

.. contents:: Table of Contents
   :depth: 10

Let's describe how the SCA scanner detects and reports changes in the check results using a simple use case.

To configure the execution of the **SCA** module with a policy file, it is necessary to set up a block as follows:

.. code-block:: none

    <sca>
      <enabled>no</enabled>
      <scan_on_start>yes</scan_on_start>
      <interval>12h</interval>
      <skip_nfs>yes</skip_nfs>
    </sca>

SCA will load all the policies present on the default policy folder; this folder is */var/ossec/ruleset/sca*
on Unix environments and *C:\\Program files (x86)\\ossec-agent\\ruleset\\sca* on Windows.

Results of the first scan are reported and alerts such as the following one are fired for every check:

.. code-block:: none
    :class: output

    ** Alert 1568287463.187123: mail  - sca,gdpr_IV_35.7.d

    sca.check.result: passed


Those alerts will inform about the initial status of checks. Furthermore, no additional alerts will be
issued unless the state of a check changes between successive scans.

In addition to the check-events, SCA will issue an alert that summarizes the results of policy scans.
In the same way, summary alerts are triggered only upon the first scan, and whenever any check state
changes, as any variation alters the summary information.

If we focus in check 3078 (whose alert appears above), we can see it verifies that SSH root login is
disabled by checking the contents of file */etc/ssh/sshd_config*.

By enabling the `PermitRootLogin` option to force the check to fail,

.. code-block:: console

    # sed -i 's/PermitRootLogin no/PermitRootLogin yes/g' /etc/ssh/sshd_config


The next SCA scan for that policy generates the following alert:

.. code-block:: none
    :class: output

The level 9 alert shows how the check has changed from **passed** to **failed**. This state is updated on the
manager side and the last result scanned is available from the SCA tab in the Wazuh app, which finishes the path
that began with the host being scanned.

The insights provided by SCA Alerts will then help system operators to take actions aiming to reduce the attack surface of the
hosts they manage.
