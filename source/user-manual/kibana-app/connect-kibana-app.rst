Setting up the app
==================

Follow these steps to register the Wazuh RESTful API with the Wazuh app in Kibana:

1. Open a web browser and go to the Kibana's IP address on port 5601 (default Kibana port). Then, from the left menu, click on the Wazuh app icon.

2. Open the *Settings* page with the gear icon on the top right corner (the first time you open the app, youâ€™ll be automatically redirected to Settings). Click on the ``Add new API`` button to open the form.

3. To protect your Wazuh API, before filling out the fields, open a terminal on your Wazuh manager and, using the ``root`` user, replace the default credentials with your desired username where ``myUsername`` is shown below:

  .. code-block:: console

    # cd /var/ossec/api/configuration/auth
    # node htpasswd -c user myUserName

  Do not forget to restart the API to apply the changes with these commands:

  .. code-block:: console

    # systemctl restart wazuh-api
    or
    # service wazuh-api restart

4. Fill in the *Username* and *Password* fields with the credentials you created in the previous step. Enter ``http://MANAGER_IP`` for the *URL* field where ``MANAGER_IP`` is the real IP address of the Wazuh manager and enter "55000" for the *Port* field.

.. note::

    If you have followed :ref:`kibana_ssl`, the URL must be set as ``https://localhost``.

6. Click on the ``Save API`` button to store it. Now you can navigate to the other app sections, like *Overview*, and start visualizing your alerts.
