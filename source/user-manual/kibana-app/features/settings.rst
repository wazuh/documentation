Settings
========

The *Settings* page allows you to configure and customize your Wazuh app experience. This section is automatically opened the first time you open the app in order to configure your first Wazuh API credentials, so the app can work properly. 

API
---

In this section, you can list all your inserted API credentials. The star icon indicates the currently used API to show information on the app. Each entry has multiple available actions to manage it. Keep in mind that a working API is needed in order to add or edit an entry. Check your API connection status prior to adding them to the app.

Extensions
----------

Wazuh provides multiple integrations and capabilities to monitor and analyze your hosts. If you're using some of them, you can enable multiple extensions on the app to visualize tailored dashboards, which provide rich and useful information. Some of these extensions are disabled by default because you have to previously enable them on your manager configuration in order to generate alerts.
